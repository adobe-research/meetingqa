    "displayText": "Right okay. I cover myself up. I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I've always wanted one of these, I really have. Where do you buy 'em from? They're. Right. Hello everybody. Hello. Back again for another wonderful meeting. Is everyone ready? Yeah. Yeah. Almost. Okay, we can hold on for a minute. My gosh. I figured with the spam thing, if you can't beat it, join in. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive. Mm 'kay. Are you ready? Okay, right, I take it that you are all ready now. Alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting. We got together just to basically decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing, and who we all are and stuff like that, mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on. What we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we know what it is that we are doing, now we know that it's a TV remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some R and D for that, that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before, see I'm learning all sorts of new terms in technology today. Mm-hmm. We're gonna hear your three little presentations, whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want. Hmm. Do you have any preference of order? Hear I'd like to hear who's from Catherine actually first. I want what I'd like to hear about is if we've finally decided on what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that let's hear from you first. Batteries. I think she is still finishing her. No no no no, it's fine I'm just preparing. Hmm. Okay. Where is that thing? Okay, Is it a crank thing or something. It's here. Sorry, couldn't see. Would that work? Get yourself in position. Ah. Okay, so that's me again. So for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which was used in the fifties for torches, if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be. I don't think any of us remember the fifties. It wouldn't be very fancy. You can have a kinetic provision of energy, which is used on some watches these days. So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work. Mm. Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but. There's sometimes combinations, calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. Do solar panel things, do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb? Mm. I dunno actually. Does anybody know? I think, it has to be on the solar energy, but I don't know. I dunno. Um. Think the what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really. Okay. Mm. And if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that. Mm. Okay, jolly good. For the case of the remotes itself, they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have a curved one or a double curved one, if you know what I mean, so kind of more ergonomic, that kind of suits the palm of your hand, that kind of thing. What's a double curved one? So then the case material itself, it can be either plastic or latex, rubber, wood, or titanium. Okay. And for each of them you have cases where for example titanium, you can't use it for if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. And if we are choosing solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material, so we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the R S I problem thing, so we could. So that might be an idea of using the rubber, but then it should. Let's have a squeezable remote. Yeah. And also it doesn't break as easily maybe, dunno So rubber would be Okay. When a TV programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost, you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you. Yeah. I like that idea. Mm. I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing, I think you'll realise that rubber is more People. Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? You think you can market that? So if okay. Ooh, we like rubber, ooh. And then there are the push-buttons, so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, or you could have LCD, which gives you a display. Scroll buttons, as well. Uh-huh. So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push-buttons. So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case. And if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. So it's a constraint. I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel? But is it a double curved one or not? If it's not a double curved, then we've got the choice for the push-buttons, if it's a double curve, we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons. If that makes sense. Yeah. If it's rubber, isn't it malleable anyway, it doesn't matter if it's double isn't a rubber case, mean it's completely flexed, it flexes to whatever they want it to? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble double rubber double curved case? No, but see, okay, the energy that's one thing, then the case is whether it's flat or curved. Rubble double double. I'll have a Big Mac, please. And that's we don't care if it's rubber or not, but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat, single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying if we choose it to be double curved then I dunno why, but we need to go for rubber push-buttons. Okay. So, either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case. Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. Okay. Go rubber. Go rubber the whole way. Let's go crazy. And then, do I have a last slide? Yes, I do. So the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics behind the push-buttons. Yeah. And the price that go with it with it, so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest. If we get a scroll-wheel, that's a higher price range. If we get an advanced chip which is used for the display thing, then that's even more expensive. Simple. Chip on print. It's a bit. Okay, what I'm not understanding here is okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is one PCB and that's got all the electronics on one board including the infra-red sender? Mm. Yeah. The infra-red. Yeah. Right. What alternatives do we have to that? What alternatives do we have to the chip on print? If it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. Mm Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job, too. So it sounds So, why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the the unit. It doesn't. It doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. Totally. Yeah. We wanna go for an all so long as it works. So let's not go for the. I agree. So let's not bother with the chip on print. So it's either the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons. Yeah. Push buttons. What about the just developed sample sensor? I think push-buttons is. What about what? There, the sample sensor, sample speaker thing. It'd be cool, but they are saying they've just developed it, I'm just guessing. What do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? Mm, I dunno. Be cool. Channel two. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and Hm. Yeah. The speech recognition option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us 'cause The example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. It's not something that we wanna go into with this product. Just clips of that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say, good morning, to it it says, hello Rick, or whatever. Yeah. But, it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turn the TV on, and comes on, but it's not that. It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response. It just gives an answer. So, what's the point of saying, Hello remote, hello, how are you? Then I thought it was when they said I thought when they said, voice recognition, they meant channel five, and it will change. Yeah. Yeah. Just if you are really lonely, maybe. If you're really lonely, it's No, that that would be more promising. Channel five. And then it switches on. Like you talk to it. Can I have channel five? Yeah. It it's just a remote that talks to you. Uh. Then forget about it. Yeah. Yeah. Right okay. To certain cues. Yeah. Okay, so I'll go back, maybe, to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem, what we should choose. So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option. Kay. I'm fine with the basic battery. Basic battery. Mm. It's cheap, it's cheerful, it's worked, does work. Hmm. Are you happy with that? Mm. Yeah. Okay. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or or double curved? We were we were going with the with the the RSI rubber, weren't we? So we want it rubber double curved. The the double whopper, please. So it will look like something like this. Double? Okay, so then if we use double curved case, then we have to choose rubber push-buttons, and that's fine? Yep, but we're going for the simple buttons. So rubber keys. Yeah. And it's cheapest all round, it sounds kinda funky, and we can also market it as 'cause we were saying you were saying earlier in your research that the people have the R people were getting the complaining about RSI, and this is anti-RSI. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's another marketing point that we can use. The rubber push-buttons. Don't you have to move your Mm. But anything is gonna have buttons. Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive. I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't. See, you can still get it you still get repetitive strain injury, whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen. It's the it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement. Mm. It's not actually what you are doing. But the fact that this rubber is actually used in these anti-RSI specific. Mm. The rubber's good. Yeah. We're giving them a way to burn off steam, basically. So they can sit there and go Mm. Not that watching TV should be that stressful. And you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at your children. I guess TV can be stressful, if you're watching sports. Alright, that's me done. Alright. Okay, Gabriel. Let's hear from you about the it's the interface. Alright. Some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about. Great. Sorry. Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface topic. And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division. It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. I also took Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration 'cause I think that's crucial as far as what buttons we are going to include and how they're laid out. Mm. And so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. It's it's pointless. Mm. It's just a sensor sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the TV. So they also give the they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an MP three player like iPod. Mm. So we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like RSI you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing. Yeah. Mm. That does get annoying. The other suggestion, and I have a feeling that we're interested in something more general, but they suggested going a little bit into a niche, like either gearing our remote towards kids, where you could have lot of colours the keys might be funny or or, something for the elderly, where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. Mm-hmm. But we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well. So, the key layout and design are really crucial. Yeah. You want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing the wrong one. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of good layout and bad layout from our manufacturing department. So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V on both of them, so it's sort of confusing for the user. Yeah. Yeah. This is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. Do we have an example of a good one? Uh-huh. Brilliant. Maybe we can Right. And for something for kids. Yeah. Um. Yeah. And so, I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page. So I was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in a niche sense. I think it should be more general. Mm-hmm. I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the LC display were crucial for us. And, that's it for me. Okay. What are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The The the interface type we're going for Just the simple straight set of buttons. So we're not gonna have any sort of display I think. So, it's just gonna be push-buttons. Um. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons, ideally, a channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. Yeah. I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that. Okay, and we're not. Now that we've decided on our it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy, but I would say maybe a couple of colours a black with yellow and somewhere, like maybe the RR can be yellow, or something like that. Are we have we decided on whether we're gonna supplement it with anything, colours or particular gimmicky bits to it, we're just gonna go for something We're. Yeah. Okay. Okey-dokey. I don't have any other questions on this. Let's move over to sure. I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before. cause so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button. But I can speak with the button department, but I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents the other buttons from operating. The button that just does that. So that should be simple. Cool. I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year. Mm. Um. Yes, so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market, we have found that for the remote control market these are most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed. Mm-hmm. The most important aspect is look and feel. So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. So it has to be Yep. Why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the TV? Exactly. Mm. Yeah. Second, it should be technologically innovative innovative. So Technologically it should be work, basically, I guess. What's that mean? It should work. It should be maybe cutting edge in some sense, have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market. Should That's new. Okay, now the trouble is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, these first two points we've already sort of gone away from, 'cause our rubber one is not fancy it's different, but I wouldn't say a rubber remote is fancy. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction. And it's it's not technologically innovative either. So, no loose That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause if you put up Bluetooth, and it's like a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's gonna 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, it really is, like people and when it comes to marketing that's what people go for, they don't really care whether, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Maybe Of course, they do. Mm. They do, but it's not but it looks good. One hundred per cent, that's your first thing, you go, I'm not gonna buy that, 'cause I dunno if it works or not. If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration. Okay, what do you two think about this? So is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just synchronise it with other electronics? But You could always insert. What I don't understand what and this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television. That's basically what it allows you to do, right? But, people like if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it state of the art. It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, does it? Bluetooth would, for example, enable you, to connect for example if you get a call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now. That would mean we'd have to make a television as well. Things like that. No, that would be your telephone in with your television. That wouldn't be the remote so much, Mm. No No, but if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to with the television. And Nah, the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically. I was just trying to find an advantage. What what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic provision of energy then. It doesn't have to be, Bluetooth, that was just an idea, but it do something that, is new. And there is no there is no such thing. Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor, but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there, and people've already seen it, people've already got it. Okay. If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have and just go creative. It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for remotes, yet. Okay. That's that's very good. And then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. Change the batteries ever again. And and this is all tying in very nicely. The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about. We should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up by doing it. And in little characters you say, but not too much. Yes, so can we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating the energy generator. I think, safety. But by the squeezing it that's a great idea. Done. Third most important aspect is it's easy to use. And I think we've all worked that out. We're all about that. Okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look. Next year's fashion very much in fruit and vegetables are the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. So next year I found this really funny, strawberry shaped chairs, and things. Okay, so we could have keys that are like a a broccoli key and an avocado key on them. Yeah. Yeah. Rubber things. I wanna watch the pineapple channel. And as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, so it's not quite spongy, but spongy, I would say is so we're in. Spongy, that's where. We're ahead of the game there. That's great for us. Yeah. And so personal what I was just saying move away from the current remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel, while still keeping to the company's image, basically. So. Okay. I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm. Right. Alright, no, this is good, so through all that we're right, we're gonna go back to going with the kinetic thing, that's great, using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-RSI you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself, you are charging the batteries, and I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though. Yeah. That's great. Yep. I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend, I guess. No vegetables. Maybe make it fruity colours or something. Some sort. Uh-huh. Or Mm. The power button could be like a big apple or something. But Apple would sue you for that. This is true. They they don't own all images of apples. Sued the Beatles so. Okay, we'll make it pomegranate, a big pomegranate. Okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally agreed on is its image. We're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we dunno what it should be, or are we going it looks slick, but what do we mean by slick sort of thing? I think, if it's rubber it needs to be different. You said earlier on it should be funky. I think, it should be what do you associate with rubber? Really different colours basically. Keep it clean, keep it clean. Okay, I sorry, I used the wrong word, what do you associate with the material that material? I'm just thinking bright colours. Yeah. Bright natural colours, nothing too Bright, but too not. Bright, but not too bright. Yeah. No lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can like. The volume buttons should be all the same colour and the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean? Mm. And on the back of it have the logo. Okay, what? Sure. Why not? Okay. The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going too much down a gimmicky road of having if somebody goes into the store they're gonna see three or four normal remotes, and then a big spongy pink tomato remote. That's we we. This is the remote control tomato. What are ninety per cent of people gonna take? I can say in this country, you'll get, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. And kids will be walking in with their parents saying, Mummy I wanna buy that one. And parents will see the pro as well, because kids won't break it, it's not breakable if you throw it around. Yeah. Especially with younger kids, they can pick it up and. The only thing is that really small kids might chew on it, but. It's gotta be chew proof. So it's quite it's quite user friendly and also for different families, family use as well, so for little kids and for old teenagers will like it, I think. I'm gonna write that down. Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be pink remote control for their room something. What are you saying, maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the Mm. Yeah. That's. Mm. So like you walk in, you're I like that remote control, because it's so bright, and then, the shop assistant comes up and says, what colour would you like? And then they go I can choose the colour wow. So it puts, even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of, you've got all colour it's either that or nothing. So they also get to pick. Personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour. That seems to work well for products like iPod, where, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, just by the fact of choosing. It's. Mm. You've got the Evaluation. Although I'd be curious to see how many there are some colours that I would never choose, and I would be curious how many people choose that colour. Right. That can be down to bit of market researching if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular. Mm. Yeah. And produce less of the silly colours, maybe. Mm. Okay. Alright. Alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then is from you Catherine you're gonna be working on the look and feel design. Yep. Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, come up with the user interface design. Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. You won't be going off to your separate offices. Alright. Okay. And I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay. Right. I think, it's gonna be able to come in and show us some some physical ideas. Mm. Cause at the moment, it's hard. Cool. Yeah. We were kinda going, it's gotta look cool and that now we can actually start, some sort of physical something or other. It is. That sounds good. And you're gonna be working on the product evaluation. Um. And I will be talking to the bosses, basically, and fielding off some more spam and that's it really. Great. Hopefully keeping things together. Um. This is this is good. So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know that we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things, so we're keeping the costs down. Mm. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff. Mm. People, are saying, standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury, this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite, It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it. Yeah. Um. We we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it, what extra things are there extra things this product have? We'll look into this lock key facility, although whether or not it happens, or is possible, don't but something to look into. Right. Okay. I think that's well done everybody. Alright. Any questions, everyone know what they're doing? Yeah. Cause if you don't, you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it. Yeah. Mm, I think we all know what we need to do now. This gives you all the details? Okay. Okay. Right. We're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish. But I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so before you all disappear off just hold fire. Okay, I'll stay in here. Um. Um. Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check, or is that So we're getting futures in the company. I think, it's gonna be more of a profit sharing on the product. I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment. So we really have a incentive to make this remote work. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits, because that's really doing well. I want a share in the space rocket. Did you see that this that this company we've made a spaceship. Yeah. Yeah. This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. We're definitely not in the money making department. I did notice looking at they told you that they wanted our product to represent the RR brand and to be immediately noticeable. Yeah. If you look like at the coffee maker at the corporate web page, it's not obvious. Mm. RR. It is to us, because we worked here for years and we use that coffee machine, but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just silver and black. Mm. That's true. And the spaceship doesn't have the R have a massive R and R down the side of it but I still want one. No. Mm. Doesn't. Okay. I've just had a sign flashing up saying, finish the meeting. Uh. Okay. Yeah. Right, I guess that's us. Yeah. It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet. So maybe you should go back to your own offices. Okay. Right. Are we taking these off? Yeah.",
