    "displayText": "Okay. And don't forget the I have a copy. So hi everyone. Thanks for coming to this meeting. As you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space. So that's a very good piece of news. But we also have to find out how we use this space. So if you want, I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can talk about, arranging the new office space. So in case you haven't seen the documents let me just show you very briefly the configuration of the space. So there is nothing much to say. You know how many of us are present and that we are a bit tight actually in our present location. That's why actually the university finally allocated us this part of the Unimail building. So it's at the sixth floor. And it's sort of contiguous rooms as you can all see from here. So the the one P, two P, three P means the number of persons. As you can see we have several corridor with a number of of rooms, of one person rooms, two person room and three person rooms. Actually I think Agnes did this nice drawing so she even put the view, so we have the old town on one side, and the mountains on the other two sides. We have some bathrooms for us. And a courtyard which actually means a sort of shaft, because the court is down at the first floor. Andre, just, a clarification question, are they number of people per room indicated strict, or can we play around with? If there are two people, is it really that you can't put three or two and a half or how was it calculated? It's a bit difficult to say, because in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture. They are here. Kay. Your person Your question actually is answered maybe by the third item. So each person should get it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner. With, of course, a chair. A filing cabinet that goes under the desk and, we can put hanging shelves over the desks. So I'm not really sure it's possible to get three desks in a two person office. But we could try. Mm-hmm. What should be said here, I don't know if, I I will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them. Maybe it's easier. Do you need something, Martin? I have everything. I can keep this for you. Okay, Are you sure of that? So it's you have a copy, Susan. Yeah. You too David, I think. Mm-hmm. So in fact there are more places than people, so we won't be that constrained. As some of us and some of you here actually, Martin and David are part-time. So it it's for the moment quite comfortable. Normally we should even get an extra place for, temporary people coming to work on projects. I I counted so we have fifteen physical persons and about sixteen, persons actually, eighteen persons in the offices. Mm-hmm. Two Six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen. But counting the the reading room. So one of the issues here, it's probably not on the slides, is that we would like to have unlike what had until now, a lounge or reading room in one of the offices. Mm-hmm. So in one of the rooms. Do we really need that? I think quite a lot of people expressed the need for that. So if we could do it, then I think it would be much nicer. Let me also say something Yep. And Susan, don't forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room, so you should be able to valorize this if possible. Okay. I think so. But I still agree with you that the the we are not so we are not so large, as far as space is concerned. Yeah. Because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions, to the best if you take two people room for the reading room, then you have sixteen places. Mm-hmm. Sixteen slots for fifteen people. Mm. So it's still should be feasible. That also means that the growth will be zero. I think that's quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can think of, some two or three, for visiting people. Visiting visiting researchers, students coming for exchange students et cetera. Correct. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, so let me finish with the constraints which are almost done. So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine, and the printer. The fax, is very small, but the photocopier is quite huge, and the printer is this size. Okay, the offices comes with white boards. Not very important. The furniture that each person has and you have a list of people. So the thing you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that we're that are thinking for about putting people in these rooms. There is another group that is also having discussions. So the idea is that today we'll just try to start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to go and think about it ask the people your assistants, for instance, and at the next meeting we'll try to come with one solution. The other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation. So if we don't get these? And if we don't get this space then what happens? These. Basically they are promised to us so Do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or I I think it's. We we stay where we are. Okay. No the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space. That's one of the problems. I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people, one being temporary or or part-time. Okay, so maybe we could try to see now what would be the main options. Say the general arrangement options. Do you think that we should put people, say, according to projects for instance? In the table that we have, we also have the the main projects on which the people are working. So how. Andre, sorry for interrupting, but one again clarification question, what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions, because at least we are half per cent fifty per cent from EPFL and sometimes you have meetings where the decision is already taken, so you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things, so what will be the impact of what we will come up with? Mm-hmm. Actually what is fixed is the number of rooms. This we cannot really change. At least not us, it would be much more difficult to get another room for instance. But what is absolutely not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms. So basically we are all the permutations are possible at the moment. So, another way of asking the question, is there any other group already working on how this should be allocated? Or are we the the one that is supposed to do the the the position for it? What we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy. So the other group is, I don't think we have to see them as competitors, but they are just trying to find another local optimum. Or. But why why don't they have any representative here. Why do we do it separately? Why didn't we have a meeting together? They have another group and then Andre and Agnes will discuss about it with. You are the representative of this group actually. We. I think there is no real competition between the two, but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how close they are, actually. It's I think the people who decided this thought it was the best solution to, mm find two kinds of opinions. Yeah. Okay. We could have been eight sitting around here and talking, but I think it's more difficult. No, but that's a standard thing. It's Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that, we'll put them put her or him somewhere else, then we will do plenty of work for nothing, because we'll not have this constraint. Mm-hmm. We'll not be aware of this constraint. Exactly, I think So so today the goal is not to find the solution today, but to set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences. Okay. Okay. Obviously we won't be able to accommodate all the preferences, but at least we'll find the most important ones. Certainly we have to ask Pierrette and Maggie, since they're not here, because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do, and so that's another consideration, too. I think Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of the things I think we know that they have students, we don't know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone, or to be with their assistant, or even with another person working on the project. So that would have been maybe, another solution is to ask everyone to provide an arrangement, but I think that's a bit hard then to work out. So since all of you have a copy of the drawing, for the next time, maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with names on it. But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people, say, by projects or just professor and assistant. So what would be, say, first your preferences, since Let's let's start with us, maybe today. What do you think about it? Would you prefer to be alone, would you prefer to be with your assistant. You who are part-time, do you think you can come here on a very well regular schedule or is it part-time, but variable during the week? Hmm. Okay me personally I would like to to share the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life, like the printer doesn't work, I don't want to ask this to my supervisor, so it's better to be with an assistant to share the room. Uh-huh. And since you're coming on the half-time, do you think you will be able to group your presence here, say Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, or is it going to be much more random? Mm-hmm. I don't think it's a good idea to to share the same desk. Okay. I still would like to have my drawers and these things. I think so too. So Martin, you are also half-time and, the third person is Gisella. I think it's quite clear that mm each person should have their own desk and. I agree with that. That's where part-time is important is that it's an load on a room, so for sure if you have a part-time person, it reduces the ranges of time where too many people in the room. It's no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk. I think grouping Mm-hmm. As far as I am concerned I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here. The thing that in my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls. So I'll be talking over the phone all the time. Great. So it depends on I have nothing against sharing a an office with somebody. I already did it before, so and it was perfectly fine. It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room, which is very much dependent on people. Some people are not disturb at all by this. Mm-hmm. Some people just can't work. Are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people? I'm not. Okay. And what might happen, but it will not be so heavy here at ISSCO is visitors. So that I will have more at EPFL, typically students coming in or asking for things. Mm-hmm. As I'm not teaching here, I'm teaching at EPFL, this should shouldn't be a such a big load. So for me it will be essentially I will not be able to be silent in the room, because I will be communicating also through vocal means, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm before talking more about individual preferences, is there any possibility, what they have done in the faculty of law, for example, that they actually split rooms? And so we would take one of the two people rooms and split it. And you would see that you would have the same size office, but that would give the privacy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building, every professor has their own office. Mm-hmm. And it's really it goes a bit far that we have to have all this sharing. Hmm. So one option but that we would need to ask about if we could split one of the rooms That doesn't really solve it there's really a difference to having to have your own and sometimes you need to have private discussions with somebody or whatever, I think it's really a matter of personal preference. Do you go for boxes for instance? In the bigger rooms where, cubicles? Cubicles. Yeah. Hmm. You mean, you really want to have walls. Mm-hmm. Four walls. Yeah. Sure sure. I I will try to find out whether we can separate. I think for the moment the answer at least is no, because it's not only, making a wall, but also mm making a new door. So it's quite a lot of work, but I will try to find this out for the next time. So at least for the moment, as you can see I can show them here on the screen. So there are these two rooms on the left that accommodate one person. Mm-hmm. So at least some of the professors, since you are four, could go could take these rooms. Yeah. And quite a lot of rooms with two persons. How do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in the teaching? As you know I prefer to have my own office. Hmm. Hmm. I also have a lot of phone calls and have to see people, with the other work that I'm doing with the rectorate that is really confidential information that I'm treating. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I That I have to be really careful about too. Yeah. But it's a personal preference. Insofar as what we've had up until now, both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others. So I think that we should still check with them not sharing with each other. Mm-hmm. I fully agree with that. It's much easier to me to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room, than sharing with their students. They each share with an assistant. Yeah. Sorry, because but that's it's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons, as you said. Yeah. You you are discussing a budget on the project, you over the phone typically you don't want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion, so No. Paid on that Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's true. Okay. Maybe we could look a bit at the projects. Do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project, since they talk quite a lot of to each other? No, because project doesn't last in time. They will change. Mm-hmm. That's what The only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people. Okay. Mm. And some of the PHD students will hopefully finish their PHD at some point. They will promote that. But still, some things. Mm-hmm. And also some of the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too. Yeah. So For example, Marianne she's also working with me on the virtual campus project, that one wasn't mentioned, but I'm not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office, but it's just to say people are working on sometimes more than one project. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. If it if if projects are what you have in mind, I think that meeting room is the tool for that. If you need to have people in a projects talking together, they just have a meeting room if it's not too far away then then it's a very good good practice. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Actually, so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room, but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in the building, as we now know. Yes. That's why I was quite receptive to Susan's remark at the beginning is I wouldn't formulate it in such an extreme way as, do we really need the lounge? But I would probably formulate it in the way that do we want to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room? Mm-hmm. Because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do collaborative work. Mm-hmm. But on the other hand we also have to relax, so that's Yes. And I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge, which is a whole other topic. We'll skip that for now. Yes. No the lounge okay, but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have visitors for any length of time, so they actually have a place to work. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's it provides no possible possibilities of expansion. Uh-huh. And this will happen. For the moment actually I think only one slot would be fully free. You can't prevent having visitors. And you shouldn't. No, you want to have visitors. Yeah. That is. Which for for fifteen people it's not enough. That means one visitor at a time. We have we have four professors here and and two researchers. Yeah. Or one intern. That's Mm-hmm. It's funny that we move to another building because we run out of space and we will have the same problem. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yes, but we have more space here than what we currently have, so it's at least some Mm-hmm. Ah okay. It's already in progress. It's bad it's bad. And you're working Okay, so one of the things I have to do for the next time is find out about the separations between rooms and I think it's quite a heavy transformation of the building. Because this is really related with security regulation as well. You can't just put walls in rooms without any specific. It's not necessary heavy in terms of work. It's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And okay, I'll try to find out. At least at EPFL. And the other question is, can we squeeze or at least four places in the three P room? I think so. If you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way. Hopefully visitors don't need as much say filing space, or they don't have that many papers. Yep. Right, that's the point. Okay. So I have to ask, so you don't really feel very strongly attached to this grouping by projects idea? No. No. Mm-hmm. No, because they can share their ideas across the project, I would say. Exactly. Coffee machines are that made for that. But usually, when new assistants come, they would like to share the room with someone that knows it's related with the project, so he can Mm. Mm-hmm. No, that's proximity doesn't play a big role there. Mm-hmm. We can discuss with people that the space is very small, altogether it's And you don't need to discuss about the projects, you more need about to discuss about where is the printer, how do I get furniture, I don't have a pencil, where is the box with the pencils, and so on. They can change. Mm-hmm. No, okay. This is not project related. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, and if you look now at the the current division of the offices, for example, Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office and they're working on totally different projects and they're just fine with that. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think that's going to be one of the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in not staying. Are you aware of any strong constraints right now? There were, but they sort of disappeared as of October when the no smoking rule came in, because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there's no smoking, I guess that's not very important option, though except for that maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony, so No. Oh. That's true. Okay, that's true. So smoking is now no longer a constraint. Yeah. Is it allowed to smoke inside an office, if it's a one person No, not any more. No. No, it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building. It's non-smoking campus. You can smoke outside. Mm-hmm. So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke. Not even in the cafeteria? Not even in the cafeteria. Downstairs? No. Full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students. Yeah. That's the new regulation. Okay. Wow. On the roof maybe. On the balcony, actually. Yeah. The balcony, okay. Yep. Yeah. Normally. There is the there's that terrace. But Andre, just Still some places where smokers can survive. Wow, there's no place inside the building? No. Wow, it's a non-smoking campus, but there are some places. But Andre, just a comment about your previous request. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I I don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom. That's a typical output of research in expert systems. These are the rules that you never get. But you can get them through a proposal. The other way. So you propose a set-up, where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that they don't want to have a view on the mountains, but they prefer to have view on the old town, so they would be in the toilets. Mm-hmm. On the toilets or Mm-hmm. They would prefer to be in another room. No, we do have one constraint that's difficult, which is Gisella, because when she's there she's very noisy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's on the phone a lot It's by. But that's the admin that's the admin so it's part of the work. It's by the nature of her work that a lot of it is communication. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes, Martin said also for him and, especially for her. Yeah. Yep. She's the interface. And that's a problem, you're right, because we don't have enough one person rooms for accommodating the admin place. So Mm-hmm. Yep. And if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space, who who else would you put in there? Mm-hmm. Because we have only one half part half-time admin and no other non-researcher positions, if I'm not mistaken. And this is really a piece of a problem. Yep. Maybe you could put some visitors, but I know. Yeah. I think. It's not very realistic in a in an admin room, because You can't put a researcher there. Mm-hmm. I think putting Gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option, because we weren't offered it would be nice, but Okay, I'll try to find out, but I. I think that's a excellent idea. Why don't we ask about that? That's just Either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager. There is certainly enough space down the hall, if all of those offices where half of them are also half time, and they're very under-used. Yeah. And Pierrette too. Okay, we'll try, but all these, are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and, people just don't wanna change in general. Yep. Let's see, maybe we can find at least a proposal for Gisella. So, since the one-person rooms are sort of desired by a lot of people, she should probably No. No that's not sure. To me there are two options possible is either we can take one person rooms for the admin, because typically, the professors have good reasons for sharing. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sharing either with a colleague or sharing with one of their PHD students. In that case it's it's realistic. Then we could very very simply allocate one of the one person rooms for the admin. And that would solve the problem. The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin. That could be the one here in the centre so the. Mm-hmm. The middle one here? But No no no, the other one, the one here, this one. Okay. This one. Okay. But then that the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open. Mm-hmm. So I would be more of the opinion to see whether it's so evident that, let's say at least the two full-time professors that are here on the list, we have one here, but Maggie is not present. Mm-hmm. If they really and Pierrette. Yeah. If if if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room, which might or might not be the case. Mm-hmm. It's certainly not something that we should impose, but we can ask. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Because in this case, Gisella could take one of the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor, that or Ah. But that's not realistic either. You have a foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put him in the admin office? Okay. Uh. You'll not do that. Maybe you can do that with an exchange student, that's But you can't take a senior visitor and him in the secretary. With younger people. Or an intern. Mm-hmm. No. So we invite and then we say, okay you can sit with Gisella. You're here. Yeah. Okay. Okay so this sets a bit the stage for Gisella then. We'll try to find out. Actually, maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the school actually share their office with their assistant. So it looks like sort of an implicit tradition. Except for in every other faculty. Maybe not to be followed. As Susan said? Okay. Is that so? Yes, it is so. Oh. Every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and that's in law, socio-economics, okay? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. It's a They all have their own office. In the in the law faculty they're at best there half time. No no, that's it. As we said, it's it's really a matter of personal preference, it cannot be something else. Mm-hmm. It cannot be imposed for sure. Yeah. It's job. Okay so I think this sets a bit the stage. Could you try please Do you want an extra piece of paper? Maybe try to, well, think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you. Again Andre, I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for ourselves. I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be, I really don't see how I could decide for Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list, that they should be there. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No the point was to try to, just talk to them, to David, or Mm-hmm. We're gonna have to. Why couldn't we do couldn't we do it for the set-up of meetings. You everyone received that and should provide I would like to be here. And then you will have this multi-constraint problem and you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution. Yeah. Will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's place? I would ask for their place. That's that's the important thing you want to know. Because Uh-huh. But that's Mm-hmm. What what about the the the cafeteria? We are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or Reading room. It's a reading room. It's altogether. Reading room, it's not a cafeteria. So in the living room I just before finishing we have a cafeteria or we don't eat at all? But that's an open question whether it's a it's a it At the origin it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, reading the newspapers, et cetera, et cetera. There has been a very long discussion about that. This discussion is still vivid, that some of the people, I belong to these people, would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure, but also meeting room if necessary. Or, as Susan said, an emergency room where you can put some visitors in a decent environment for for for work, because you don't have any other place to do it. Mm-hmm. But that's that's really an open discussion and that I think no decision, no final decision has been taken about that. Yeah. Okay, Okay then for the next time, try to come up either with your own preferences, that's quite easy probably to state now that the constraints, or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be even just discuss for instance, No, no, I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this. Yes. Yes. The one that I don't want to have in the next room? Okay. And I think, it will be nice to come with maybe a sketch of these. If you can do slides, it's even better, but don't be that formal. And we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal, and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one is available. Okay. Okay, I'll ask Maggie and Pierrette if they have any preferences. Um. That would be great. Great. That would be great. Mm-hmm. Perfect. That of course is not main but one of the important features that we need to know about. Yeah. Yeah. No. Since they're not at the meeting it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them. Yes. And I'll try to Fine. Yes. We don't have cafeteria. What do you mean by cafeteria exactly? He means reading room. A place what mm we can take a coffee also. We can bring your coffee in the reading room, So since maybe, you're here, and part-time at EPFL, there are at least two coffee machines in the building, one at the third floor, one at the first floor. No, there is no coffee in the reading room. No? That was the wrong We we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines, so Five. But they close at five or? And we can bring our coffee. No automatic coffee machines. Ah okay. No. Coffee machines. Okay, okay. So. No, the cafeteria is downstairs, but they close at five. But, in Uh-huh. This. Ah that's the main problem. But there's the two machines, and they're the vending machines where you just put the money and you can get. Mm-hmm. Vending machines. And you can bring your coffee in the reading room. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Maybe this is not a very bad timing. Could we try to meet next Tuesday? To try the coffee? Wait. Next Tuesday maybe at maybe a bit later? Maybe at eleven o'clock? Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Next Tuesday. Tuesday don't forget we have the MDM meeting in the morning, so it would have to be in the afternoon. Come on, try try to be nice. Not so easy, eh? Give me a reasonable date. Yes, I have no constraints, so it's fine. For me it's a good timing. Uh-huh, okay. Next Tuesday we have a meeting. Yeah. Exactly. That might be Where is the meeting? It's Unimail? Yeah. Okay, so, then it could be that. At nine thirty, but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon. That that would be great, because that would allow us not to move, or not to travel twice. Okay. Nah? Mm-hmm. Very well. Yep. So about two o'clock? Would that be okay? Okay. After lunch. After lunch. Yeah. It's not a very demanding meeting, so Perfect. Okay. Right. Yep. Okay. Then let me close this. And good luck for your arrangement games. Thank you.",
