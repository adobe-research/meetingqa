I got this big black border on every side. Okay. Mm, okay. Everybody ready? I'll I'll fix it. It's okay. Whatever. Welcome at the functional design meeting, again presented by Maarten. This is the opening. We've got three presentations. And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me. And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions. We have forty minutes. Yes. This is the closing already. So we start off with the first presentation then. I think we have to do it in right order. Okay. Maybe it that. I don't know what the right order is. So Mm-hmm. No. Huh. It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions. Okay, how can I get this on the whiteboard? Yeah? You dumped the file in the in the project document folder. In project. Okay, I've done that. You've already done that? No can that open. Yes. Let's close this one. We'll just open a new one. Open it there. Yes. Uh-oh. New thing. I have to say something. Due to some technical problems I haven't digitized the meeting minutes. But I'll make sure that happens next time. Okay. About the get Okay. And I'll get this one in digital form too. Kay, we're going to talk about working design. The method of the remote control is electrical energy, it activates a chip in the remote. It's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television. Mm, it's nowadays very known, a known technology. The known technology can make a cost very low. It's a wide sale of remote controls in the world. And the components are very cheap. Diodes, batteries and LED lights, they're needed and they're everywhere available. Again, it's a fair price. Technology like I told the circuit board, it's the most important part of the remote control. We can use for that fibreglass with copper wires, it can be made as fast as printing paper. It's all very they're making it all the time. Okay. And it's not very specialised technology. Okay. I haven't come to here, but I've got some images of remote controls. They were not very trendy or just a remote control like everyone knows. So I don't know why I should put it here. Yes, but I haven't made it because of the time. Okay. But it's the technical side of the remote control. Oh. Okay. But What? We'll have to skip that part then. But you don't think it's a problem to design the technical part of the remote control? No. It's gonna be easy? Yes. Okay. But nothing restricted for user interface? Yeah. With technical I don't know. No, it's just a part of a known technology. Okay. Kay. Remote control is nothing special nowadays. Regardless of what type of functions we want to implement. Okay. Doesn't really matter. I don't think so, because of all the televisions there are maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions, but is it useful to put them on a standard remote? But I kind of Yes. Okay. Okay. The technical functions. Okay. We'll see. We'll see later on. I don't know if you got the same pictures as I got, but I got these two, and I think we have to focus on one hand the expert view or the novice user. No. No. It's very much depending on the user requirements, don't know who's doing but I think that's very important to watch what kind of functions there we want to put in a remote control. Will there be some user requirements later on? The ones I've received from the account manager. Yeah. We'll keep this in mind, and then discuss it later on. We can put functions in it when we get the user requirements and we can update it. Uh-huh. Okay, but this big distinction between this type of remote. We should choose one we should not compromise but really choose for expert viewer or novice? Yes, I agree. Yeah. That's what you want trying to say. If you want try a a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. Okay. Okay. But I don't know. It's really depending on how how far the the remote controls are already in use. Some of these. Some of that will but it will be more clear when we come to some of the new requirements. Probably. Yes. So Mm-hmm. There are at least basic functions, like just one till nine, on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Most standard have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. I think that's just basic what we need. And from that on we can user requirements what we need more. I thought Joost was looking at the trends in the markets, and are any if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's becoming less trendy or something like that. Yes. You can just you can you can keep it in mind that. I haven't really found a conclusion like that. Yeah. I don't know. I thought the with less buttons you can make a more trendier design. Design. I think. Sounds interesting. Yeah? That's all I have to say, I think. Okay. That was it. Alright. Then the Marketing expert can tell us something about the current market. Yes. Yeah. It's alright. Alright, I've done some research for functional requirements. Yes. The working method there were one hundred people, how do you say watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out a questionnaire with a few questions. I've lined them up here. Ask whether common remote control looks good or not, about willingness to spend money on remote control, about zapping behaviour, and stuff like that. I have found some interesting things. We do we do got a market. Three out of four people claim to find remote controls ugly. So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach. Three out of four users zaps a lot, as I quoted here from the results. Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour. That's quite a lot. Relevant options are, of course, power buttons. Although, only used once per hour. Channel selection, volume and buttons for text, and the more other functions, like audio settings, video settings, sound settings are not said to be very important and very much used. Furthermore, fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off. But it sure says we shouldn't make it too complicated. Fifty percent also claims to have lost a remote control very often in the room. And an important thing here, the most important customers which is over seventy percent of our market, is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old. And elderly people, our market, are less interested in nice features, but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls. So, what I was thinking wrong side. We shouldn't implement too much features on our remote control, because elderly people will get lost. Group features for a higher usability, what I was claiming in the previous meeting. All the settings, about audio settings, video settings and channel settings, which are not very often used, we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever, because they are used very rarely and there are a lot of options there, so we can really make how do you say, we can spare at buttons over there. Okay. And if you want to implement VCR and DVD options, group them in the button, not too. Small buttons, so how do you say Yes, won't be very present, thank you. Visually presents. And a trendy look, although seventy percent of the market consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever, I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent. That was kind of what I found. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on what features we find important. Yes. Some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant, I think. Because They decide to put two additional requirements forward. Now I see four. Two? That's kinda strange. They say teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. I think that may be so, but we can't just leave the teletext button off. No way. No I agree. It's impossible, I think. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, on and off, and put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or it's just you want to be able to make use of teletext, but not to play with it that much. Not too much, no. Yeah. So we have to think of that. The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time to market. So maybe we should leave all DVD and VCR related features off completely. Yeah. Okay. I don't know. I think that that's what they're trying to say. Our current customers are within the age group of forty plus. New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty. So you talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested. Mm-hmm. But, they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger but it is a it's a fact that that bigger market you're talking about, we already cover that. I don't really agree actually, to be honest. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty. It's only thirty percent of the total market. Yeah? Our company already sells remote control to the older people, but we also want, a new customer group. That's the one we haven't covered yet. So I think that's what the problem is. We haven't got remote controls for I think. Okay. Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit. I think so. Maybe if it's no no, but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants. Not too much then, alright. So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group, but isn't that bad for an older person either. Yes. Our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. Okay, something else nice to know. But what's our slogan? Sorry? You will have to look that up. The slogan Puts fashion in electronics. I'll have a look. We put the fashion in electronics. I think it's something about the okay. I thought it might be, let's make things better or something, but Okay let's go back to the agenda. Sense and simplicity. Sense simplicity. So we've now had to the three presentations. We know about the new project requirements. That means we can discuss on the remote control functions. If I can make a start, I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be, and maybe you have a familiar with the remote control that has the can opener underneath it. I think we're looking for some we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic TV functions. That. Yeah. To be honest, if our aim group is till forty, not older than forty, maybe that's not very we don't really need to have a simple remote control. Yeah. I think we can implement more functions then, because basically the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more Yes. But But you said that a lot of functions aren't used. That's why a lot of the requirements the account manager sent me, I think they are are contradicting each other, because they want a simpler design, and no other functions than just TV, but they do aim at a younger But I think we can make some distinctions in what in the, know, in functions you have different kind of equipment in your room, like a TV and a DVD player. Yeah. So why should we put this function in? I think Yes. I think younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than more functions. Know, you can make very you can put very detailed functions regarding the TV set on your remote control with the audio settings and screen settings. We don't want that. I think that was that became clear. We don't want. But maybe I know that the younger people will most likely have a DVD player they want to, control, remotely. Control. But you said but the functions are not in the remote control we're making. No, the user requirements of the the new project requirements told us not to But maybe. It's. Yeah. I think we should put some functions maybe for other equipment on it. But just the basic functions. Maybe rewind and wind, or what do you guys think? But you can put them under the same button. Not much more than that. Yep. As far as possible. Or we can we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever. So. But what do you think? Should we implement features or functions to control other devices? No. No, you don't think so? No, new requirements say no. The new requirements say so. But if it's too simple they use their own with lot more functions. But you can put a play and stop and and rewind. Maybe there there is something most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their own remote control. A lot of DVD players have some tricky settings with Yep, exactly. Yes, but we. Yes. That's No no, you don't No no, you don't need it. But but for for example, VCR, that's better example in this case. I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme the VCR to start recording at three PM or whatever, just play, stop, rewind and fast forward. No, no. Exactly. No, no. Okay, but we have to think DVD I guess, so but from my experience it's kinda a lot of DVD players, like forwarding, goes differently. I know, but Yes. You get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed. Mm. It's sometimes a bit difficult. Maybe if we just leave the DVD I was thinking about putting it in, but concerning the project requirements and what you just said, I think we should focus on the TV then. But just keep it simple and look more at No. And it's just a complimentary remote and not a universal one. If you want to keep it simple, you can make a universal remote. It's only for television. Okay. So. Yes, there are But how will you be able to handle a whole market? It's just a it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table, and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch, you pick up the the the nice remote, the simple one, just to put on the television, nothing more. Yeah. Nothing more. Okay. Exactly. Alright. But we'll make this one trendy. There are a dozens of remote controls that have Yes, but you could put on the zap buttons you can put it to access all the same pages. Yeah. And simple. The user interface is easy. We will come to that, but first on the functions. So we should put zap buttons on it. Also numbers, to go to the specific channels. And the basic functions. Yes, definitely. Okay, a teletext button should be there. It's too much integrated in the other. But just one big teletext button, on and off. Yeah. Probably. And maybe two or three other options, but not nothing more than that. I think stop function is very useful. If you have a page which consists of more pages, and you are not a very quick reader, then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up, but I use it very regularly, the action. Okay. But I think that becomes too difficult, it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then. I I use it quite often. But maybe you do, but I've never heard of it in the first place. Will you look Look at the market. And teletext is becoming outdated. We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably. Yeah. I don't know. I think that that's getting too complex for our remote. It's Sunday I always use it for the soccer when you look for example a couple of weeks ago I looked for the flights, and there are a lot of flights in one page, but True. I don't know what you guys think. Might be. Might be. But do you like to have such a stop button? Or I think it's a kind of very rare and special function. Yeah. Okay, it goes but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now. That's why it was said in the in the new requirements. If you have seven pages, you can go up and down. Lots of new televisions can store pages, and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it. Yes. Then we meet the new requirements. We also meet the other you you just we have to choose for the the simple design, I guess. A simple. Okay. What functions do we have to decide on? Or I dunno if we have specifically name all the functions we want. We have the zap and the volume. Should we do make them very big? The the the zap button. That's that's that's considered to be trendy also. I think the plus and the minus button should be quite present, yep. Yes. But trendy. I don't know. Or maybe you should place them in a special way? Maybe we can make a kind of a joystick. Something or special way to zap through the it has to be and quick. Original. You have to use it very quickly. It was True. Yep. If you grab the remote, your hands should be on top of the plus. And the buttons should make it possible to zap through your channels at a rapid pace. Yes. What should we decide on then? I think in a case of this simple remote control, the technical aspects which weren't worked out already, but it shouldn't be a problem then. But No, it's just signals and the television does the rest. Yeah. Yep. Maybe the batteries maybe. No, okay, but when we don't want to control other devices, I think it makes it even more simple. No. If you use large batteries or small batteries. The most standard batteries. I think that we should use not the watch kind it has to be simple, Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house. I think double A. Yeah? Yep. Yeah. The most ordinary batteries. Okay. Yep. Oh. How much time do we have left? More than thirty minutes? I think about twenty minutes. Ten twenty minutes. But in a way we have to be special. These shouldn't. Early break. Okay. But that's have you have you thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Maybe For the remote control. Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget kind of feature or it was something about how we lose them. Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. I think that's more for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever. To find him. Yeah. That's maybe. I don't know. I don't know. Nah, a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things. It should be a birthday present or something that you give someone, and it has something nice. That's good one, yep. Yeah. Or maybe it should have a big light that can flash or something on it, or maybe it should or the the can opener. Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control. I think it's very because we're gonna make such a basic remote control, we have to do something to make it special. Yeah. It's gonna cost twenty five Euros. I think the can opener is a brilliant idea actually, because television and beer is not a rare combination. But it's already been done. But that's. Nah. That's true. And I think very it has to be sturdy or something, maybe with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. Yes. It has to be used something special, and it has to, not people, when they buy it, they have to think, this one lasts for a long time. Yeah. Yep. We're really gonna use them. Not some thing you throw away next week. No, that's true. So maybe I think that's when we decide on these type of functions, basic functions, it's very important to find something like this. So there's a very important task for you. And maybe we can all think about it. Be original. Also for you maybe, it's very nice when you can be trendy, and and as in a friend use friendly as well. Mm-hmm. And use friendly. So big buttons, flashy design, and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Must brain-storm. Uh-huh. A swapable front or whatever. Or just different colours would be I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their remote control. Why not? It could be you never know, but it and I think we have to make it quite big. Yeah. More money for us. Yeah. Quite big. Yes, definitely. You think? People and also because it is expensive. That's to be a formed for your hand. If you want it to be something, it's doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to make it Mm-hmm. Yes, it it should be visible nearly anywhere in the room. As I said during my presentation, fifty percent. And and should look nice when you put it on a table. I think you might wanna put it that it it it stands up. A standard or something. You have to put it on its So it's like a vase or something you put on a table. A face? Or. No no, put stuff inside it. Yeah. More like a joystick then. But, it's like a statue or something but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That it's fashionable. I see what you mean, yep. It's like you have four phones. Something like that. If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. I don't. In the base we could make a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself makes noise. That's probably stupid, but as I found here fifty percent, was it fifty? But that's fun for the first time, and then the second Or you can. Fifty percent often loses remote control. But when it gets lost, how can you press the button to make it okay. No of the base the the the the the the thing you put it in. On the television. Like this. That's kind of nice. If a button in that you can make rechargeable one. And then also you don't even need batteries, because you can make it chargeable. A chargeable. Yeah. That but No, I think that it might be nee but we don't. Why not. Why not. Maybe you, but we don't know much about production cost, but you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of rechargeable units. With recharger. It should only cost twelve and a half Euros, of course. Aye? But we'd do it in Taiwan and So, I think it's a great idea. Production. Okay. It should be possible. I think it's a good idea. Yeah. Some kind of I've never seen that before, and you see it with the mouses nowadays. To make a base or something? Yes. Yes, definitely. Yeah. Yes, but is that handy? I it's really you can recharge it, so you never have the battery problem. It's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy, it's Mm. That's one. And you can always find your remote control up okay. But remote controls nowadays can last three years, with two batteries. Maybe when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, but you do need also an also you would need a battery in the base unit as well. And then you Yes. It makes it kinda. You could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts, of course. Or But you pay for it. I don't know. Okay. But it's ugly, I think. Yeah. But then it's very easy to make it also a I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it. No. On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay. It looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it, but I think the bay is definitely Sure, why not. Yeah. I think it's a good idea. And make it, we we it's it isn't a most costly remote control. We can save on the on the functions. We just put some simple button in, make it big and sturdy, nothing more, and just make sure there's some noise that it can make, or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it lights up, it's also nice. Yep. And if you put it away, I think we have to that's it's not a easy market. Yeah. Yeah. We have to something special. Yeah. And for twenty five Euros people want something remote special from your control, and we can't deliver that in with regards to the functions, because we aren't gonna put. True. Yeah. Definitely. With eye candy, ear candy, whatever. Definitely. And then when make it, nice looking shape and this and then you got the stand-up thing. Yeah. I think I think it's a good idea. Yeah. It must be a gadget to have. Yeah. Definitely. We will see what's possible concerning the costs, and if it's possible we'll do that. Yeah. And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing. And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to to skip is then probably the recharge function or something. If that's too expensive, we won't do that. We Or just give a beep when the battery's out or down. But it would be nice. It would be nice, yes. It's the idea. I know that batteries last long nowadays. And what people just think about, I'll never have to buy any batteries again, so because it's very annoying when your battery is empty. And then when you haven't batteries around, and probably for two weeks, I've experienced that okay. Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty, so yes. So, easy functions. We will I think we'll work that out, zapping, numbers on it. Why not. But it's also annoying. Cause as long as it stays as it keeps working, you're not very motivated to do something about it. Hmm. Yeah. True. Then it beeps all the time and. No, that's true. You don't want to have ever have those problems, and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable. And you don't have to use the unit, you can also put it on the side if people don't like it. In the but if they pay for it because they think, that's a great idea, I'm gonna use it. Why not. And when time goes by and they think, I'll never put him in the recharger, last long enough, then they put it on side and they can use it now and then. Then when they get I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control, within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they're seeking for the remote control, they wanna see something quick and just push the button and I think it's brilliant. Yeah. Bleep bleep it is. It's so simple, but I've never seen it. Yeah. Yeah. No. And you can leave it just there. Nearly. Maybe we should really do this. Yeah. Yeah. Okay now, how much time have we got left? These clocks aren't synched. Yes. Now it is twenty Okay, so we have ten minutes or something? I'll fifteen minutes. Something like that. But we're done. I think. We've decided on the functions. There is some. There is a closing sheet. We have lunch break, and then we have thirty minutes of individual work. Oh. Okay, I had some problems with digitising the first minutes, the the next minutes won't be a problem, but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too, but maybe it won't work, but you'll see. I think these are more important than the first ones, so. We'll see. Can you make a part of folder for the minutes maybe? Not everything in one folder. Maarten, five minutes. Five minutes. Because I I did the first minutes I did were were a bit scratchy. Then I did a second one with a nicer layout, which I could use for the other ones but I think I forgot to put done under the first one, and when you go write a second it's not working when you try to write second paper or something. Yeah. Maybe. No, that's true. And then you had to overwrite it or don't. It was not my pen. Should we by the way draw on our nice whiteboard, a little idea of. This kind of looks you like. Of the shape. Or the Do you get an idea of the shape? Probably, it would be nice. I dunno. Has anyone got a little bit detailed ideas about the shape? I don't, for one. Maybe like this pen. A bit bigger guess, but The shape is nice, it's something different, and we want that. No, bigger. A little bit bigger, but look at the pictures. It has to feel nice in your hand. I I have to say, I have this can opening remote control in my head most of all, or I think some maybe no, that will be too costly. Yeah. We could also, that would also be an idea, but don't if it exists already, you should make Alessi or something design it. Okay. That would also be nice. But then you then you don't but then you don't have that's not something that's in the production cost it's a one time, was it's a single cost. But twelve and a half Euros? But then nah, I don't I think that it would be more expensive, because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive. That's true. Would be a nice idea though. I don't know. I think has to be a it has to have round forms or something. Something like that or And on and then a base unit underneath it. Something like that is very ergonomic. So. It's also round. Put it in there wire on it. Maybe I don't know, some lights, a big. Flash lights at the side. Volume and programme. At the side, or something like that. Yes, volume and programme should be there guess, because your hands will be in the smaller part. And some of the extra Some of the extra functions over here. Yeah. And the numbers on top, I guess. Numbers. Yeah. And and lights? How we're maybe a ring of no, no, you have to Maybe on the side of it. Maybe rounds sorry. Side of it. Along the side strip of. Just two LEDs or something on the side. Maybe lights also around the volume and the the plus minus programme buttons. Yeah. But I also meant the blinking the ones that also blink when you try to locate your remote. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Theys have to be. Probably at the side. Look at the front, but exactly, and then there is. Exactly. When you you see it from the side, then it would look just like that. And then you have a strip of lights or something. Something like that. Okay. I think it's nice, for one thing. Maybe put something on top of it or. No. I don't know. No. Or some bump. I think I think that'll be too big too big then. Maybe some? Bumper or something. We'll have to think about it. I think we're we're done. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, we are. We can save this one. Lunch break. Alright. Yes, I guess it's lunch time. Okay then. Mm mm. I don't know. Half and hour? I thought our next individual round was half an hour. Okay, five. That was what Mm, we'll hear about it. I don't know about the lunch break.",
