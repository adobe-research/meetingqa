    "displayText": "So we are here to talk about functional design. Now hopefully we've all got a better idea than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now. So here's an agenda. I'll open. You should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings, as I was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation. The additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful. Now you can all give your presentations. We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions. Right, forty minutes for this meeting, so a bit more time than the last one. Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them. Did you all receive that email? Yep. Yeah. So does anyone have any overall Mm. What comes up for me is that if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext, and so we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now. Mm. Yep. So that's, from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack. Mm. And so we have to go, in the other direction. What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Right. That first point could also be an opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated, some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented, guess. Yeah. No, I agree with you. So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side what are we gonna be targeting our market that identifies our product as better because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Okay. So that's that's that was my reactions. Okay. Yeah. But but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television. So we're quite fixed. Yep. So probably, in terms of marketing, are looking for that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product. Okay. But we not design the TV. Yeah. Hmm. So we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any TV that people use our remote with. Yeah. Kay. That's right. Hmm. I think we take with you. So it's kind of a stupid decision. But there's also the potential for there's a market here for our lost teletext. Right. For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible. Twenty-five Euros is the selling price, we really have to innovate here I guess. That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody, some people are gonna be unhappy 'cause it took they can't access their teletext. Mm. Okay. Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext. Yeah. So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all. It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring? What are we bringing in to take the place of this, and we have to in my opinion we have to double up. Mm 'kay. If we lose one we need to bring two or three. Okay. Okay I think that the last point is probably quite straightforward. Obviously the the it has to be branded. So then the double R will be our our I I I I think Rolls-Royce might mind, but don't worry. Kay. On the product. I think one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics, right. Can you handle that black and yellow? So I think our target here is to have some kind of very sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well, but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like this thing here. We don't wanna a big clunker. Mm. We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so That's fine. So you have this? Nah. So we have three presentations, and I think we'll go in order of participant number here. So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two. That's Okay. Yes. Okay so you all know me, I'm the Industrial Designer. Mm it's enough. But click it on off? And we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need, just basically every remote'll need 'em. We need some kinda of power power source. We have to decide on our user interface, which is his department, but the user interface is also a major component. We need a programmable digital signal processor to take the input from the user and translate that into electronic signal, which we pass to the infra-red LED, which you aim at the television which and it receives that signal. You need a on-off switch I don't know how that got in there. And have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of TVs. So we need to know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well. So here's just a basic layout of how the remote would work. The the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there, and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing, and then passes that signal on to the infra-red LED and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor. So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much open to move around. Now would this be considered just a standard This is not cutting edge technology we're talking here. I think any No. We're talking about existing technology. Right I think this is just a basic layout of all the components that are gonna be absolutely necessary to have a working remote. Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries. We can add things in if we wanted some voice recognition, that you can kinda say would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip. Okay. Okay. Do we have an idea of costs of different components? But the most costly components are gonna be the chip and it could basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well. The LED and the transistors and everything else they're pretty cheap. Kay. So depending on what we want our functionality to be, the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap. Depending on the amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and how much power. Mm 'kay. Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet? No. I don't have any figures right now. Kay. We have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that. Yeah. Okay. And I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual casing itself and the the buttons and things like that. Mm. Mm the shell? Yeah. Basically. Okay. Okay. So. That's all I have really. Okay. Thanks. And we have participant three, which I believe is Pedro. Hey mouse. I can give you that to click on. Open. And you wanna View a slide show, that's what you wanna do? When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun. Just go up to view. Uh. Click, don't. Mm 'kay But I think what the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it. This doesn't work. So function design. You guys know me, Pedro, and what I found is we want to do fashion and I think, honestly, we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design. Basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we we have to make it look good. Something cute and small. The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties. So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at. And although most people will buy televisions and everything that have loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't get too mad of actually having to go to the to the television to, for instance, tune in the stations. There's no need to have that in the remote. So as for what I would recommend for the interface design, and I will change the colours on the logo, we should go for the user-oriented device, so simple controls and good ergonomics. And although I I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, guess, but we should go for the. So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. Mm-hmm. Because otherwise we're just going to even if it's necessary or not, if you're given the choice between a remote with teletext or without if it if it isn't more expensive for us to make because as far as I understand it, it can be operated with the same set of buttons? Right as far as it's just the cost of an extra button. So it should be in there. Software-wise there's really no difference. Yeah. Okay. I think. Maybe what we're getting into here is the idea of Internet through the TV for example. I have maybe a silly question. I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext. I I don't understand how those two things are connected. How does how does computers and teletext how why is one eliminating the need of the other? I don't understand that. So that might play on what we can do. They're basically aiming at saying that you would use a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check for the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now and now you can look it over Internet. Scheduling. To find out what you're watching even if there's commercials. Okay. But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities. I think I I agree. cause, I don't see the cross-over between computers and television. I do see the cross-over in some sense, but but but with the remote is used for television, okay. But it's not happen yet. For me. Yeah. You have digital TV still already. So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote. Unless you have a. There is a for example on digital TV systems you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts, and you can view through a catalogue for example. Okay. Mm-hmm. A family member of mine has got a system where you can and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live TV and things like that. They're just features from the Internet from computers are coming into the TV sort of under the covers, but you still use it through a teletext. So now the things to think here are that there's gonna be more functionality, potentially that we can handle. Okay. But we don't we're not aiming a command for that. That's the thing. And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one, so I dunno. I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways. You're not gonna be able to, you, command a TiVo with our remote. Mm. I don't think. But still there there's an opportunity. If it's, for example, a trainable one then we're just simply having an up, down, left, right, an okay button or something like that might do as well in future proofing it. Mm. Okay. One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or, make two separate interface designs. I think if it's possible you should try to have a talk with management about that. Right it's just not. I don't see the logic. Yeah. I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext, I just I I but I'm not a tech-mind either. Yeah. And neither do I in fact. I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and 'Cause we are designing something for a television, okay. Uh. I'll communicate that back to those guys there and the message really we wanna be sending to them is that, although teletext may become outdated there's no logic in not having it in there anyway if it doesn't affect the price. Yeah. We are selling it to an existing market. Yeah. But I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe. But there's no putting anything in the place of teletext. I dunno I'm Mm 'kay. That's and and, and we're also marketing a product. That's the problem. It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product. So so we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns. Mm. Yeah. So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext, again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable? Hmm. So if we're keeping it. Cause we really don't have anything else there, do we? Yeah. I don't I don't see it, and to me if I'm gonna market a product for for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price. I need to make it special with a high price tag. I don't want to make it economically competitive. Mm-hmm. I want I want to market it as exclusive. So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something but but I don't think we have that flexibility. But if design is cheap and functionality is basic, then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden standard TV so the place remote then the place we're going to justify that cost is through design through making it a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote. Does that make sense? No I no I I understand what you say, but what I'm okay we probably need to move along, but my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product, and if I'm coming in with with twenty-five Euros, which is mid-market price, then what am I going to give these people for this? Mm. We probably should. We we're doing alright for time. Yeah. So that's just my question, but we can keep talking. Okay. Sorry that kinda cut into you there. Right. No just I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands. As for, the case design maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas. Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness, cute and small. I'm just thinking with all these universal remotes that are out there, how many people actually use every feature like these trainable remotes and things like that, where, it's just so confusing to use all these functions. Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna they lost their TV remote, they need another one that'll work with their TV. They want something that that isn't gonna break when they drop it, that maybe it's ergonomic, it feels good in your hand, something like that. Mm. I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest, market share. So we are looking for something that looks good and just works, rather than looking for any special features. Is that Mm. I think the more bells and whistles we add, it's just gonna cut into our into our profits. Because I think as we add costs for things if we add the voice recognition and things like that, I think what percentage of the of the market is actually gonna use that? Maybe five percent, and how much Right. Mm. But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this. Okay. Be a good idea. I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut in. Yeah. Sorry boss. I'm not the boss. Okay. Pedro, I just want to say quickly I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles, eh. Sell things come to my mind is something that's voice-activated. I know we're getting into hope, some big money on this thing, but Is that over here? I think that's probably a question more for this guy here. Yeah. Okay, alright. It's kinda both of us. User interface. Is it? That's 'Cause and I think of how many times I've lost my remote and I can't find it. Okay. Mm-hmm. So some way that I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something and so so But this's just something. Mm-hmm. I was thinking about that. Then your lights would go off, though. Mm. I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about taking out teletext, it's what are we gonna put in? What makes this thing attractive? And it's only for televisions. So we our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their VCRs, their DVDs, their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only. And so to me we have to make this a really special product I I I don't I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product. Yeah. At this price I don't see it yet. I'm I I go along with this, because this is what we're given to try to market, but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market. Hmm. But we that should be design. Yeah. That should be the design basically. Right. I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it. We don't have the money to do it towards technology so we should we should aim at design. Okay. Have to do you have to do it in the box? Yeah. Okay so that's up to you then to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary. Yeah. Okay. Maybe make it in the form of a gun. We can sell it in United States. I have a question for you. Does any of the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about in terms of just pure functionality? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or Okay. I don't I think all these things are pretty standard. I think we'll be okay. Kay. Cheers. Onto participant four. For marketing marketing for me is and how do I go here? Okay. Mm you can just click. Go go. Is that right? No no no you just get off that. You just click anywhere. Ah-ha. What for me I don't know what I'm marketing right now, okay, 'til you spoke and when I wrote this, I don't know what I'm marketing. I just know that I was identified as a we identified ourselves as a developer, as a manufacturer, and as a distributor to other wholesalers. And so the the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price. Mm-hmm. That's what we decided here. So what I did is I decided that this needs to be a product in a sense can market itself. So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design. We're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is. So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left. Mm-hmm. So I would like to have a product that we can sell easily. So I say inspiration, so having something beauty, something attractive, something that in a sense will sell itself. Mm-hmm. Innovation fits into what we're talking about here with design. Cutting edge technology, I don't think we're gonna have that, these were ideas I was putting together, unless we come up with some New Age product as far as the casing is concerned. I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way, so I talked about environmentally sensitive, maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home. I don't know. These are just thoughts. I wanted to talk about who we are as a corporation, that we're aggressive, we're competitive, we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line. So to me it's about selling our corporate identity along with the product. What I found is that the projected costs are competitive. Mm-hmm. We're kind of in the middle of the market, but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I identified new technology, but again, because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations, I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing. If we could have a technological something Mm please. I have an idea. And it's kind of along the lines of environmentally sensitive, and it may even fit into ergonomics, and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote, what we were saying it's a common issue. Mm. What we can do is, that throwing remotes run through batteries like crazy. Yeah. Right? And for some people. Solar. Maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had a power cradle? But solar Blah, I like it. A cradle that is there to hold the remote when you're not using it, so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote, and instead of having instead of having, replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote. You never have to go through the go through all these different batteries. And also you can I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design, but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole. You could have some kind of a sexy design for a cradle and the remote itself. I like the idea, but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double. It it would increase the cost. But boy, we can sell this thing, because there's no batteries, it's environmentally sensitive, we can identify it as a safer product in some form. And you could page the remote if you lose it. Maybe there's a button on the cradle. Yep, that's right. I really But the cost No no. Now the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per? No no, we have we have to change the end cost. I don't see it anyway. Do we necessarily have to change the end cost because Can we do that without changing it twelve-fifty per product, if we basically can sell more based on this? That's gonna be up to these guys. My reaction is no, but see I see I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product. What I can do is Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our final numbers. Mm-hmm. We can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be Nah, I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext. Let's sell this wholesale for fifty Euros, sixty Euros. Let's make this thing really exclusive, environmentally sensitive, high-tech design, ergonomics, all of this. Just make this thing the the Rolls Royce of remote controls. I. Every home's got to have it. If you don't have one, hey what kind of remote do you have? You've got one of those, fantastic, I want one of those too. I just don't have enough money right now. I just don't know about that, because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate, the DVD player and, the stereo system and all that. Which is a pretty basic function that we've opted out of. And additionally we're maybe not supporting teletext But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have. Yep, one thing I don't understand is they've given us this package, okay. Mm-hmm. Now in my opinion we need to give them a package back, okay. They say okay here you go. They gave us a a foundation of of what they want, and and it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I don't think it's our place to create their product for them, maybe it is. I don't know what kind of role we have in the corporate ladder but to me it's okay, here's our ideas, okay. Mm. And then let them look at those ideas and they say, we can raise the price twenty percent, we like this idea, no, but to me it's about a choice, do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and then and then discuss? I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing handing us right now. Mm. I don't see it. I I I I have to disagree though. I think our market niche is basically people who have lost their remote or who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer, they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote, and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote. It does what they need. These aren't I I think that it Right. And to get back to another point, sorry for cutting in I think it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple TVs, 'cause it's selling on its own. It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi TVs or or whatever. Right. Right. No I understand that. So technologically, if I understand it, TV remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and DVD remotes. All you need to do is train them to the individual one, all you need to do is know the some four-digit code. So saying that it works with all TVs is equivalent to saying that it'll work with DVDs and other things. Mm-hmm. Nope, they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions. You wouldn't The interface will be different. They've identified this product That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this. Okay okay. We have done this. If we if if we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs, VCRs and everything, then I can see the market niche, but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext. I see. Mm-hmm. And it's whoa in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable, because who wants just a television remote? Right. Here's Right. And I'd Mm sorry. I don't. Here's my thing about that. If you're in the market for this ultimate remote, you're not gonna go for just a television remote. If it can't control if it can't control your your DVD player and if if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote, that just you can throw all your other remotes away. That's right. I'm not gonna buy a seventy-five Euro remote. I I I have a tendency to agree with you. I really do. So we really can't chase that. That's why I say I I I question the marketability of the product. I really question where we create the demand. So that's what I'm saying Mm-hmm. We're really looking for something basic. The one thing that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're carrying the corporate identity with the product, but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here. We're selling more than just the product. We're trying to get mind-share about Real Reaction to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics. We want people to eventually say, that's Real Reaction that's a good make. It's reliable. And we're gonna win mind-share by either being a fantastic product or for it working, it just being good, reasonable-priced, and solid. So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing. I think that's big. Okay if you drop the cost, now if you go to the other side of the cost scale, and you make it less expensive, then all of a sudden now we're going into a a new market area. So we can say low-cost good design, beautiful, wa-da-da-da-da-da. Good design. We only have a few minutes left. But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market. Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote? For for a multi-function remote, that's a mid-market price. Okay. I think so. In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about eighteen, nineteen Euro, and that's for the multi-functions, DVD, VCR, catch-alls. Okay. And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle, and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls. So to me, to market this a only a television remote control we have to change consciousness. We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous, and I don't know what that is. It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features. I'd be inclined to say, if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost, then that's the way we really should play it. Yeah. If we can take it down to fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it, we're really doing that to sell the brand. Yep we have five minutes left. Rather to to sell for Real Reactions. Or I I we're talking about the other end now. And I can communicate this to the more senior mm people within the company here to get a reaction. What about the idea that I had with the cradle? How do you feel about that? Or how does everybody feel? How does everybody feel? I I think The other the the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer, would I wanna buy that? I like it. I like the idea, but we have to find out. No, but that's the thing I don't think it's necessarily the other end. And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs, I'll take it to different I I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down. Mm-hmm. It if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair, and that implies that there's only one TV user. Right. So it's very good for some people but it's not a like But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent. It would last for several hours on its own power, but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle. It Mm-hmm. You have to sort of remember. You have to shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and. Mm-hmm. I I I think it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that I'd really want because of that fact. Mm. But I I don't know, that's just my opinion. I think again it we have a cost issue here. If we're gonna go in this direction, to me we're going to the other side of the cost range. Are we gonna make this selling the cost as a high high-tech environmentally sensitive whatever, or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range? Mm. Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet. I don't see it yet. Kay. What do we think maybe we should Pedro, do you have any opinion on it? We should keep it simple, mm medium-low cost area and make it look good. A question I have in in a 'cause I I I think I agree with you on, we gotta make it a box. The box is gonna sell it the outside, the casing. Really need to wrap up now. Can can can we have multiple designs? Have a traditional, have a and so so instead of them all looking the same, people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from. I don't know what that creates cost, or Yep one over another. The problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a poor design. Okay, I hear that. But what we could do is we need to, have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is, the best fit. Complicated but. I think what's really important is it has to look good, it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand, it has to be durable, it has to and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap. Yeah. I think I think we have to make sure people look at it and feel like its like a quality remote. Even though the cost may be low. What what ab what about a a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote? Just an idea. Mm-hmm. Just okay 'cause we all know what a remote looks like on the outside. They're selling these things everywhere. Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity, is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone. Or what if it looks like a pen? Doesn't matter. Yeah. I'm just I talking about some something to make this thing unique. A pointer? It That's the thing, I'm gonna keep thumping on. Yeah. I'll sell whatever you guys design. Mm. Yeah. I don't have a problem selling a product, that's not the issue. I give you ideas, you guys create the product. Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it. Don't worry about it. I just give you these things now, because these are my thoughts and feelings. Okay. So just to touch on my point one last time that I had brought up. Unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that it's possible it reduces the usability of the remote and the fact that you can't lose it on your own, I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having a power cradle. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Because I really think in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just, because I know at the end of when I'm done watching TV that when I'm done, I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs. Maybe that's just some people that like that. There's also remote controls remember that worked this hasn't been done in a while but as a watch. A lot of people As a watch? No no. There is remote control watches but I think they're a sorta eighties thing, so it might not be easy to market in it but the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now. Mm 'kay. They are not simple. Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know. Mm-hmm. One thing I just thought about when you were saying that, is that the our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken We gotta stop? That's what I was saying. Who's lost or broken their their remote. Gotta cut up. How many remotes do they wanna buy? Can we can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one? Exactly. Mm. Yeah. And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something, to to think about, how have people been been losing or breaking their remote? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. How does this happen? The last remote you'll ever buy. And also presumably they've Exactly. And and then and then design the product, maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy. If we're going down that then we don't need to go it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make. Yeah. Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there. True. Right. Yeah. The locator'll definitely be more expensive. Mm-hmm. Need to look into whether we can do that but I think we have some mobile phone-based products checking quickly our Internet. We really need to finish up here. We can make it in the shape of a coffee pot. But we have the power-adaptor products. We sell power-adaptor products. So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology. Just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting. Yeah. So we have the we probably have have on-line in our in our system, we have the ability to create this, we're talking about. I think so, without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here. A charging system. Right. If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics. Right. I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is, never buy another battery. Okay. Yep. Something like that. Kay. Thanks guys. Yep. No that's not what I want, look it here.",
