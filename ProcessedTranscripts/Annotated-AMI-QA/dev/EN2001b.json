    "displayText": "It's with cameras. Yeah. Hmm? You look quite funny at the moment, Tim. This isn't supposed to look like just Ah, sod that. Okay, there. Nice. Group K. Da. Yeah. I guess. Whatever. I never get this, so what's the point of if this is strapless if this strap's supposed to go behind I obviously doing this wrong. Obviously failing this calling centre and Like this and then what the shit has to do now. You have this going behind your ears, the. Yeah. Look's good. Yeah. Okay. Yes, so actually I just realise I don't have power, let me just switch on the other which is gonna run out. Okay. Okay. So there's probably not much to talk about at the moment in terms of talking about each other's stuff, beyond what we've been talking about yesterday. That's true I think. So what I've been thinking is maybe if we try to really make sense together of the XML format to be sure that we can all produce the data that we are producing in a way or at least guess my data I'll probably load in from completely different way anyway because it's matrix, but all this stuff that goes with annotation, that we have it in the right format. Maybe if we just sort of pool what we know about the XML format and try to make sense of it. I don't at all know how to go about this. What I did just now is I downloaded some XML files and I was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and try to see if you understand the general structure and pool together what we think about the structure, what we think that things mean. And then talk about how the annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way. Yeah. Hmm. Or but I don't I don't really have an idea like what, other words, what we would do today in this meeting. What's that part? We haven't got that much to talk about, I don't think. No. Just maybe talk about how you would give me your data file. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, we can do that. That's the interface between having the topic segments and calculating the information importance of words. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I I would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters inbetween each segment. Alright. That's the way it works. It's got delimiters in-between the the boundaries. Okay, and then I can make files of that. But if you're happy to do that. Alright. And you're saying you need a a label for each segment. But the most you don't need a one. No, I don't know it, no. I could give you an ID, but it'd be quite difficult to actually give a topic a title. That's fine. I just I just need a a title for the file, but doesn't matter what it is. Right. Okay. That's no problem. Yes, so does anyone have a good idea where to start what so what is it we talk about getting in at the moment? We're basically just 'cause the two of you will merge your data together, right? In some way in the end it'll result in one annotation. Mm yes. So the only thing we're trying to tie in is just an additional annotation which is similar to the annotation about what what would it be most similar to. Simply to the segmentation information or Okay. Yes, perhaps but they're all very very similar, all those XML files. I had a look for example AS Mm. I'm not sure it Ah. Mm. See, that's what I was thinking. Not sure what software I have at the moment, which would be hello? Ah. Does anyone know any good standards software displays XML, I'm not sure. Take Mozilla. But I'm afraid I only have Firefox and Firefox doesn't have the nice XML viewer anymore. Hmm. I think I don't have Mozilla. No. I can probably just Emacs them. So then when we are mixing our values together, is it a value for each expression, for each sentence or something? I think for me it's quite difficult to say on, what scope one annotation would have. Yeah. Mm-mm. I think it would be certainly more than one word and I think it would work best with utterances or segments. Yeah. I would just end up with values for each word, so I wouldn't have any boundaries for segments at all. Yep. But But going from from a word business, wouldn't it be easier to then go back and calculate for each utterance? I just would have the words, and then how long each expression would be, don't. But what is an utterance. Each turn, so if we. I think just the segments as they're segmented in the for example in the point point six five. Okay. So what we would fit into the XML files, would it be a value for each utterance? Or what you Okay. I think so. And you would probably still need your values perhaps for the keywords that are displayed when you click on something. Mm-hmm. So then we would have to fit in more than just one where values. Mm. But that's another representation then, for the importance measure. So Does anyone know in which file the actual, what's it called, the splitting into the utterances? But Mm uh-huh. Should. Yes. Is it not segments? Is is called is that Is it What does it end with? Or is it dialogue act dialogue acts? No, it's not. For example, there's BDBOO one C point six. Does it with with SAX? Does that look like it? I can't see anything very much, but that's it. Yeah. Okay. I think that's it. Be nice. They've all got an ID for each utterance. Let's actually just see if maybe K right. This is how much time you spend just getting the right software going. Is that better to see? I guess white and black is better to see. It's better. Can you use a bigger font? So just see if I can view Okay. So This this But what is this? Okay, so here each segment that's really all segments, it can be words or topics or anything I think. That's why it's for example, time provenance dialogue act or time provenance segment or time provenance No, but it. And it's got a different file for each speaker. This doesn't contain any content. Like any text. No, it just points to the words. Wait, somebody explain that slowly to me. So So what do all these things in this file have in common? Other others point to the dialogue acts. So that's kind of the global thing that ties together other things. What what are they? They have their NITE ID, the time The segment is what is displayed in one line by NITE. No so they are segments in what sense? What's definition of a segment then? The I suppose so, the utterances. But also includes things think so. Okay. And and that's usually dialogue what what's difference between provenance dialogue act and between segmenter? I don't A dialogue act annotations of dialogue act. The segment thing looks into the words XML file and the dialogue acts thing. I think it's in No, their annotation of dialogue acts, and one segment can have or one of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several dialogue acts annotated on it. So is that just another representation of text? That's why it's from words. Just see, can we have this files somewhere. So the stuff that's that's called segment here that do we know which file this is pulling from? It's it from words XML, is that it's saying here? Yes. Let me see if I have that words XML file. So for example look at Okay, let me just try to get them all to a different screen. That's just below. So we would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts. For all those that point to the actual words. Is that what we were Sorry, I'm trying to arrange them, so that we have one above the other, so to make some sense of that. So no. Here I'm just trying to understand what this segments file is about. But I think these segments are perhaps not exactly what we are looking at, because that's just one tying all the others together. Or we are going to create a file that looks more like the words file. I think. It's referencing here it's referencing to a certain position in the words file. So it's that non-vocal sound one here. That's the mic noise, okay. But does it always just no, it's it's referencing to several word structures. So this would basically be a sequence, right? Yes. So that's from W fifty two. Are they not ordered from W fifty two down to W what are we talking about? They are. And sorry. To discourse marker, DIS F marker point five. That's there no up up. That's there. No, above. Go up. Right. Yeah. Okay. So this so this is somebody saying it it doesn't. Do we have any confirmation do we actually see from this file who's doing it, just out of interest? Yeah. This is all the speaker D. You and the speaker D. Oh. Sorry, in speaker D's file. So this is where he'd like time stops. And then it only starts at a later time, because don't see when I'm pointing at screen, it's just for this. So then it starts here this time against speaker D because in-between there's somebody else. Yes. You can see whether there's somebody else or not. Okay. You can see that in the W point first it's W point five fifty four and then it's seventy six, so there are this number of utterances of other speakers in-between. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the the file with annotations for information density, what would that be like? Would that be the segments file, giving a start word and end word, or How would that be to best tie in with the system? I think we would also need two of those. Sorry? I think we would have to have the same structure, one that points to it, where we tie together, all our information. So we would perhaps have to make one that's similar. Something like something like this or like where you give sort of a reference to a beginning and an end position. Yes, and then another one that would perhaps give the actual probability value. That would be in the same file, wouldn't it? We have a I guess we could introduce a different We have for now if we just do something which for every segment in here attaches actually can we not tie it to the segments file? It could probably be in the same file, don't. But if you have several layers, then you can't represent them on the same file. Would that not be the way how they would want it to have to do as if we in the end, if we want to attach to each of those segments one number for now. And those segments do they have an ID? I guess they do. So this is the ID of a specific segment, right? In segment point one. There line below. So the problem is. But you'd think that the easiest way and the way how it's intended to be would be just, if we have here a link to the segment, an ID for that segment, that we just create another file which links to the segment and then has an additional value which is the number. So you mean an an attribute. Yeah. That's what I meant actually. Sorry, I thought we were talking about having two files. I think that I understood wrong. I thought you were wanting to have two different XML files, with one the reference and one just just the number. And I was thinking that's probably what you meant, just for each sort of our segments having just the ID, which is referencing to these segments here and another attribute which is the value. Mm-hmm. So this whole information we would then store in this Ah, no, that I don't have access to because I didn't download there's this one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which attributes they bring in. So we would add that to that file? Mm. Saying that sort of we bring in information density. And then we would create the file of that type, which we probably couldn't call it segment. I'm not sure. We probably might have to have a different word for it. I'm not sure if it there's any trouble with it repeating. But I mean there's not all the information that is in the corpus in there in the segments file. Wouldn't it be easiest to just incorporate a new attribute in in this file? In the existing segments file. I don't know, that's probably not very nice but would quite easy, wouldn't it? I reckon actually if we make a copy of it What are you saying about the I doesn't the lazy loading apply to everything? Yeah. I think that is just the things that are loaded every time, but we have lazy loading, so it can load more than that. Perhaps we could just try to cope. To make our file one of those lazy loaded. But I've no real idea how that works. I mean that it sort of dynamically loads. But yes, but it has a basic thing that it loads, I think. So for example every time it loads the segment things, it can't it can't not display words, I think. You think it it it loads the whole of the segments file every time. And it I think so. That's how I understood it. Okay. The segment at the moment is split up over. Because otherwise in the in the other things there is no information about what the participant name is and so on. So in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing. But they display the segments in or that the utterances in their user interface as well, where the words are displayed. So so they have they have their utterances displayed in their interface. So they access probably this file and then they display the words. So why shouldn't we be able to do that? The problem is probably that I extract all the words and then I don't use an ID or something for it, so it would be difficult to write it back to the right position. No but I think it's too early to really discuss that in detail, because we don't at all understand at the moment how the loading works. So maybe if we go ahead, do you think it would be possible for you to do something like segments or maybe just a copy of segment which has an attribute for each segment, but it is with a value with a density value. I mean it wouldn't be difficult to create a file of that shape. That would be no problem. Would it be easier though, because all your methods are sort of not working with their whole time frame structure there. So would it be easy for you to to tie the things together. If you're doing it on the word basis here with those words, that in the end you then tie it back into the right segment here. You probably have to do a bit of. I don't know how about you with your words, but for my segments were the F zero measurements and all those values I get from there. I always store the start and end time of everything I calculated there, so I would just have to put it yes. You're doing it time-based at the moment. So this isn't directly having time references, but it is actually here. It is. Okay. So if you slice it up by time, you'd probably be able to just attach just some attribute of info val just to each of those segments. But actually my segments are not always the same as their segments, because and their segments, there are Pause pauses sometimes. Mm-hmm. Can you not just leaves those lines blank? Yes, but one segment of theirs is sometimes two segments of mine, that's just what I meant. Alright. Okay. Kay. I don't understand enough of what their data structure is. This probably would be a lot easier would I really understand how they are handling the data internally, 'cause then we then I could say it's easy to just tie it in if you just have it time-stamped that just reference by words and stuff. But at the moment So you would you're doing you're doing a word by word base. Mm-hmm. Okay. But does the word picking, does it always have the same information value in your thing does it depend on its position like It depends on the position. It depends on the position, I think. Yeah. Hmm. And you're doing this via some software that's like external software, so you can't So what if you if you get the results from that software and you go back over it then with that file sort of, you write an algorithm which then goes back because they're in the right order still and stuff, right? I could use a different approach, though. It Mm. So that shouldn't be a problem. But this is by speaker here which makes it slightly more difficult. Hmm. The problem is that actually NITE XML probably provides a lot of the tools that we'd need to do that. But for example I made a file that contains just the start times. Mm-hmm. It could contain end times and words for all speakers of all meetings. That's just the same thing as I gave, to you. In in a temporal sequence. But displaying also a start and end times of every word. So you could perhaps use it to match it with your additional information you got, couldn't you? What did you use to make that file? A Perl script. Just in Perl? You didn't use an XML parser? No, no. Okay. Would you think it would make sense to just take file files by speaker. It doesn't matter what input I give to Rainbow. So I just could use the files as they are. I don't know if that's that would give an output. But would the information density algorithm still make any sense if you split them up, because I thought the whole thing is that you look at the frequency of a word in that specific how often a word occurs in a certain topic versus how often it occurs over the whole corpus and that from that it calculates. Hmm. I don't know. Mm. No, I think it's not versus the whole corpus. You have certain categories, and you measure which words have the highest information for one category. Mm-hmm. So it's the categories across each other I think. But would you then not get the typical words for every speaker? If you Because it would then say how it find that it's that speaker. Probably. But it's strange. I have a gut feeling it's not a good idea to split it. Yeah. No, but it can't be that difficult. Hmm. If you if you already have you have in the right order all the words with a with a score to them, and you have a file which has each word and a time stamp. Yeah. Yeah. So those two tied together have each word and its time and and and and its and its value. It's probability. Or value. Yeah. But what the problem is, I don't know exactly. I think the information gain in Rainbow is ordered by the value of the information gain, not I am not sure if I can get the right order and the values. That's the problem. So they're they're at the moment It appears to me that Rainbow was made for something quite different. But if the order stays the same, it's no problem at all to just write back again. But if it's ordered by information gain, I don't know where the words come from, because it has a bag of words representation. Hmm. Yes. Is it is. It was made for text classification. Hmm. So, could you put the more information back in then? That's the problem. I actually are you actually sure that Rainbow is doing a measure, is returning a measure of what we are trying to measure, 'cause it seems to me that it sounds like something quite different in many aspects. What it actually does is that you put in some documents, and you have several documents per category. Mm-hmm. And you have several categories. And. And then it measures which words are typical for a certain category. And if you get a new document, it will compare which words are in that new document. Yeah. And if there are a lot of words that are typical for one category, it will assign it to that category, and if it's typical for another one, it will assign it to that one. But where do you have the original category information from? It's because you have different files. If this is your directory, you have a directory one, two and three. Yeah. Yeah. And this represents the category. Everything that's in there is in category one. So where do you where do you have them from at the moment the split up? Just split it up somehow. But the topic isn't it? That's a topic information. In the in the topics, in the human topic so you've split them up by topic at the moment. Yeah. No, I've just split them up somehow by there are several documents for each meeting, and I just put one in each category. But Okay okay okay. So it's not very sensible at the moment, because I'm waiting for the topic segments or I'm just. Cause I was just thinking that doesn't make sense at all, but if that's just while you're waiting. Okay. Have you ever looked into different ways of calculating, 'cause I was just thinking for example the what's it called, the entropy calculation, is that she boxed it under the simple calculation that you could probably write the script in no time at all but I'm also just I think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment looking for. Probably. Maybe it's better if I write it myself, because otherwise it's too easy to just split things up into bins, and it wouldn't be any work at all in terms of programming or something. I can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show you the entropy code that I wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because we used we have to we'd use the same matrix as I'm using in my latent semantic analysis, you'd use to calculate entropy scores. Alright. Mm-hmm. And then we'd have a score which would be the same for the word in each position. So in that sense it's doing something a bit different, and basically the score that I'm talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information, the fact that there's one word tells you about what would be the next word. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word, in which case they are usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot. Yeah. How does it calculate that actually? It's basically the it's the standard entropy formula. Okay. And you you Yes, yes, it has. So how sure or unsure you are about what's following our context measures. I think sort of the official description of what it tells you is the fact that a given word occurs tells you about what's the next word's gonna be. Yeah. Which doesn't sound too exciting, but it just works out in the way that words which are promiscuous and which occur with everything all over the place have very low scores on that, and also usually end up being the words which are Least expressive, and contain less information. Function words and stuff. Function words or just very general nouns. Probably for example the word computer in that context. You could imagine it to be in all the contexts. Mm. But do we have enough enough data for that it gives us sensible things? Because the words we. So we wouldn't do it by word, we would sorry, okay, I was getting that actually, sorry, I was getting that wrong, I was getting it from what I did my project. Now in this case, we would do it per words per meeting. So. But that's almost similar to what I'm doing, because words that are in every class, that are not very informative, but words that are only in one class are very informative for that class. I don't understand what you okay. Yes, it's probably doing it's probably doing quite the same thing in the end, but I'm just saying with that thing you would easily have an algorithm which at the moment provides you for each word with a score which we can use. Okay. Alright. No I was I was describing the wrong thing. In this case we wouldn't be doing how much it tells you about another word. In this case we would be given that a word, how good is it at predicting from which specific topic that was. So in that sense it's the same thing here. That's. Mm-hmm. But that would give the same value for one word every time for a specific word. For a specific. Because then it would be quite easy to re-integrate it into such a Okay, but then it would also be possible to re-integrate it. For a specific word per per All over the place. The same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place. And in my case I think it would have different values for each category. Okay. But in that category it would have the same value at each place. Do you know what I mean? I But but your category thing depends on that we not just have topic segments, but also that these topic segments we have them in categories. It would be a bit more work, but then Yes. Yeah. You you wouldn't you need several documents for each category? Or several segments for each category. That would be best, but I would have to look if that. Do but will it word without that at all? At least it works if there are several categories with one document each, but it. Cause so in our case basically every topic would be its own category. And the question is does the algorithm still make any sense in that I don't understand the algorithm enough for that. That's the don't. But what I'm really like because the entropical calculation is so simple, maybe we should look into making that score just as a preliminary score that we have. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. It's a very it gives you I've looked at the result, it gives you basically something in the end which vaguely tells you just whether a word is a very specific word or a very general word. And I like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words, if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words, that they would get us somewhere. And what score would a word get that just occurs once in all the corpus for example? Probably one point zero is very high information value. Even though there are all the other same topics where it doesn't occur? cause in a sense this is a bit like what document frequency over total frequency. Mm-hmm. Measure it sort of just going by What do every sequence of the same Mm-hmm. Hmm. Would it be higher-scored than a word that occurs in every sequence of the same topic? We have our several topics. For example we have twenty topics, and for one of these topics there are five occurrences, and we have one word that Yes, but across meetings there will be the same topic several times. Within the topic, so topic we had to when you say topic, just from a beginning to end point, within one meeting there are several topics? But we don't have that information anywhere, do we? Ah. It okay. I thought that was what you were doing. When it splits the topics up, it does do it on regular words that occur. But you make also segment similarity, I thought that would And they are not related then to other blocks of Okay. But it doesn't tell you what they are, no. But but you you are segmenting. Hmm. I'm doing one on segment similarity in the end. Yeah. I'm doing finding similar segments, basic latent semantic analysis. But for now, your segmentation is just splitting a meeting up into different blocks Not from what Colin is doing from what I no. Yeah. You can't really get any other output. No. No. It's only like I'm writing an algorithm that which then tries to also again based on word occurrence patterns try to link together maybe different ones of those. I okay. I misunderstood that then. So that. So how would it work? What would his information then be useful for in Rainbow? I thought the point about that was that we would put into serial categories all the segments of the same topic across meetings. No, I I thought something else that we just split I need somewhere to split, and that splitting at category boundaries splitting at topic boundaries would a nice thing to do, rather than just splitting somewhere. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's supposed to split it into coherent topics with the similar information. So. But then it does okay. I'm not a hundred percent sure about Rainbow being the right thing, 'cause it seems that Rainbow does in its structure quite rely on having different examples of the same category sort of in a way. But I think it should work for just one document, because it compares between the categories, and if you just have one document it still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not. So if you have just one document in each category, and there are a lot of occurrences of the word in each one, so this word will be not very informative across the categories. Kay. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So it should work for one, but I'm not sure if how exactly it calculates everything. I think it's not possible to look that up. You know what, as a byproduct of my LSA I'll provide a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is. Not which category, I'm not lumping together separate topic segments into categories. Mm. But just how much this word tells you about how likely that the occurrence of that word makes it that it's a specific segment topic segment. Mm. Which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific to a certain segment that is. And I'll just provide that, because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing. And then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff. So if you keep on working on Rainbow meanwhile and try to find a way how to tie your Rainbow stuff into some way that we can attach it to a certain time segment. Yep. Maybe it's possible to have a list that is ordered by don't know. I'm just thinking, if It used is each word completely unique, sort of does it treat each word, each occurrence of word, as a completely unique event. Or no, it it has to, basically the form of the word is important, right? We can't just replace the word by an arbitrary string. Mm-hmm. Because it looks if the same word occurs again and stuff. I don't know what you mean by that. It has to work with a I think it's a stupid question, it it has to work on on the word, on What I was thinking is whether if we replace the word by something uniquely identifiable, then it wouldn't make a different which order it is. It's Mm-hmm. Right. But that wouldn't work because it needs the word, because that's all it's working on. It's the word and that looks if that word occurs again versus how often that word occurs in other context, right? Mm. So we can't attach some type of information to the word, just to the word string itself, like making an underscore, making the time or something, that wouldn't work. Yeah. Mm. Alright. You can use some kind of truncation maybe if you attach a number to each word and say that it should omit the last part. But would it have that in the untruncated version then, would the output be the untruncated version? Probably not. No, I don't think it would. No, no. Maybe I should try something different and just programme it for myself. Because Mm. For now, really just I think if we work together on an entropy based score. It's let me see if I can demonstrate let's just keep on talking meanwhile and I'll try to start that up. It's it's it's really it it's a very simple thing, but it it basically just does something which tells you how specific a word is. In a sense it's in a it's it's basically just to to a high degree really telling you how how rare a word is or how common a word is. Mm-hmm. But as the first step that's probably for a prototype for next week that's probably not a bad thing, even if it's just that. Hmm. If you have segments where lots of rare words occur, highlighted in darker red than segments where all the very common words occur. Yeah. That's just that's somewhere to start from. And it's it's a bit more sophisticated than that, but then de facto it just ends up doing that mostly, from what I figured out. Actually I think I'm not gonna start that now, because that's probably gonna take too long. So if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis, and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base. Mm-hmm. Yes. I haven't really decided on how to really get the information out of this now, because when I have for example increased speaker overlap, that applies to several turns of course. But I could give the information about, how important this is to each of those segments. Kay, what about the following model? This is a very unscientific way of doing it in some sense, but what if we take time as the standard unit for now and sort of make a massive one segment split super-array. Because everything you're doing can in one way or the other be tied down to actual time. So if we if for if for each one segment time slot we could attach a value, and then it would be easy to then go back if we have the time marks here, and re-map that onto the length of a segment, what? So if you have for each word say and that word starts at this segment and ends at that segment, and you have for for some time period the overlap and that period on the F ones and that period or something. So you also have a value which can be tied down to a time. And then we could just in Matlab or in something just create some massive super-array of things for each sort of time sampling slot and calculate a value for this, and once we have this array, we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say okay, this is from our time segment here to this time segment there. So we take the some of those and divide them by by the number or something, create the average and put it in as the value for the segment. You know what I mean? But how can we get to know what makes sense as a function for joining everything together? Oh. Might be difficult to find that out. That's that's a fiddling play in the end, but that problem we'll always have. Yeah. Because we don't have a way of usefully evaluating automatically what's good and what's bad, so it's probably always gonna be a question of looking at it and saying okay, running it with different different factor loadings and seeing okay, this way it works this well and this way it works that well. Hmm. Pros but we should break that down to have the smallest unity of time duration should be one word. That would be because that would be what naturally came out of her thing. Hmm. Mm-hmm. But it probably be more difficult for mapped to map for you to map it on so for you sort of so you say that like you basically say having an array where each cell is one is is one word. And sure, but then if I have the value for a segment, I would perhaps just give all the important or mm no. You you could always find out how many words there are in an utterance, couldn't you? Yes. Yeah. So For example. Mm-hmm. And then you would map your information onto individual words. I would say that someone have to break it down, aye? Hmm? I would probably somehow have to break it down to that level. Would you be able to find out which word that is and 'Kay, and then we could have some type of just point in the end where the one scores from all the individual word cells get multiplied all for each utterance or whatever. Yes, sure. You have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance. That's sort of the combination of of the two scores. Probably somehow it should work that way. And then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here. Mm. So that we because in the end we don't want it on a per word basis, but probably on a per segment base. Okay, but at that moment it would be better for me to just make it on a per-segment basis right way, and let her adapt it also to the segment basis. But Mm. Hmm. Actually that's true, so that it's easier if you are able to I think that's probably back where we started at this. Mm-hmm. But you said it but you said it's more complicated, because your segments aren't those segments exactly. Yeah. Mine are only more, but they have the same start and end point. Sometimes they're two segments and one with a gap in-between, but have they don't overlap. Hmm. Hmm. And their segments do overlap. No no, they don't, but they're my segments overlap in the same way as theirs do. Those do or those don't? But sometimes I have split one of the segments into two segments, but it's easy to match the start and end times to map it to their segments. Mm-hmm. Okay. So you could on their granularity create a score for each of their segments. I hope so. Mm. I guess for you, for each word, if you find that out, then it has to be possible, because if we know sort of this is going from word to word or this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay, this concerns these following words, and then just make a simple mean over them. Then we. I think an interesting thing is if we don't combine your two scores in the XML file you had, but if we do that in the software, then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of adapting some sort of control, like look like it's playing with different weightings for that the utterance-based one versus the word-based one and sort of look at it dynamically. You know what I mean? Playing around, sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around and looking at the results. Mm-hmm. We could even have a look at our different measures, if they come up with the same kinds of. That would be quite difficult, but. Yeah. We could probably make a graphic display initially, at least for our experimenting. We'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other. That's what I'm already doing with my separate it's tells you even which words it is. Okay. Yeah. Do you think like both of you then can map something onto their segments, like just each of you provide one value, double value or whatever, one decimal value or whatever onto exactly their segments. I think if I can provide something for the words, as they are It's stated to where the segments go. It should be possible. It's stated both in It's done both in terms of words and in terms of segments. So it should be possible. It's a bit sad sort of that we do this before we've truly figured out how the NITE XML thing works, because now we're doing it all by hand and parsing and un-parsing that thing and it's all part of the framework. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. How much easier would it be if we truly understood this. I'm sure it'd be quite straightforward, some of the tasks we have to do. So 'Kay, I might just change my order in which I do things and forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the NITE data system now, so that maybe as soon as I've understood that we find ways of doing that within the NITE framework already, so that we don't manually have to parse times and entire things together. Mm-hmm. But yet no one really understands them, the actual XML parsing. You mean by matching strings. Or what? At the moment what you would do to solve this problem is you would sort of write some Perl script or something that gets this time value out of here and Okay. But what I've done is an XML parser where you can get the start times. So, that's quite easy, because it's an attribute and you just say that you want the values of those attributes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So provided that you get your words in the right order, do you think it is an easy task for you to it it's a relatively feasible task for you to to get just a single value per segment? I think that should be possible. I don't know how long it takes me. But Mm. Okay. And you say you think you're able as well to map onto those segments. Yep. Should be possible. And if you're both able to map into those segments, then we should be able to get one file where we have whatever two values, value A and value B both as attributes for this. And that we could load into a prototype and see what types of what ways of displaying this information are there. Yep. I hope to have some value quite soon, but I just calculated the values values for the average F zeros and I didn't have a look at the data yet, but they vary quite widely even for the same speaker across meetings. Hmm. So one speaker had an average of about a one hundred in one meeting and one hundred sixty in another meeting, that's strange. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Perhaps it's because of laughter or something, that's what I was thinking, but I didn't have I'll probably look at it. There's probably also social interaction factors in that there's sometimes just a meeting like if people adapt their F zero to each other, then they're sometimes. That's what I read in one of those papers as well but it could mess up things quite considerably. Can you not do something just not measuring the F zero or the amplitude at all, but just like the variance of F zero within a certain time frame and sort of just have some part for its very low variance with more the same F zero and one where there's a lot of more variance. Actually I don't know about that at all. Yeah. But. But all this is quite, data-intensive. Yeah. When I let the just calculate the average F zero levels, I think it needed more than half an hour, considerably more than what have half an hour to delay it for our meetings, because we have seventy five hours per, average of six speakers, and they're measured every O point O one six seconds. Sorry. Mm. Hmm. And that gives us quite a lot of values. Okay. So at the moment you just you measuring the F zeros relative to the average for the speaker or Mm-hmm. What I did at the moment is I got the F zero values for each speaker for his headphone, and I only take those that were recorded at the time where he was actually speaking. Mm-hmm. And for those I calculated the average. Mm-hmm. Zero. So the average Okay. So that gave me now one value per speaker per meeting. So what you would be feeding in would be just one value per speaker per meeting, so that that that's that's your average baseline, okay okay. No no, that's just the average. No, that. No that makes that makes a lot more sense. So that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment. He or she. Yes, I just needed to have this value now to relate. Yeah. Yeah. And for you that would be quite easy to translate into those segments. Guess I've asked this question fifteen times now. I think. Yeah. Is laughter annotated at all? Sorry. Amusement and so on is. Because you could take that on ours out maybe. If you take the laughter out and then calculate it. Yeah. I I actually have to look at the data what causes these Because it's quite funny to have a male speaking at two two hundred. Mm. Yeah. They do exist. Sure but Mm-hmm. The Castrati corps of the International Computer Science institute. I'm afraid I have to go soon. But not quite sure, is there anything more we have to talk about anyway? Not the moment. Maybe if we meet at the weekend. I don't know. Yeah. See, as soon as I'm halfway through my LSA basically as soon as I have the matrix built, of the document by word stuff, it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score, and I can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want. Yep. So no, how about the prototype. If we want to show him something on Monday, we definite have to work together. Some of us at least have to work together to get it running probably. I think Colin, Dave and me will actually work on the Java stuff, and we'll just see whatever you supply us, we'll try to tie in and visualise in some way or another. Alright. I'll ask Jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock. That sounds like an idea. So that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had. Yeah. Just send us an email and tell us what's happening. I haven't gotten sort of my confirmation that Wednesday is fine. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to expect a confirmation for my confirmation from him now or but I'll just email him again and ask him if we can maybe make it one sorry, we said twelve and I'm asking if he can make one. This is a bit frustrating at the moment, this project, isn't it? It's so difficult to get to the point where you understand enough to really feel that. I don't know, I'm not feeling that I'm really working at the moment, I'm more just trying to make sense of everything. And it's a bit too far into the meeting for that, and into the project for that. And I am at the moment fiddling around with my data and not quite seeing how I get to a sensible abstraction level. Hmm. From my very. I guess as soon as we have a framework in the type of the prototype where sort of each of us can tie in their stuff and see how it looks like and how it performs. That probably makes it a lot easier then, but it's a boot-strapping problem, for the prototype we need some type of data, but to develop the data it would be a lot easier to have the prototype. Anyway, I gotta go. Yeah. So you will be happy with some data, even if it doesn't make much sense. Me too. Hmm? Yes, but if it's in a form which is easy to read in at the moment, that would be fine. Sort of like basically if we have something like this segments file, but for each of you just have one attribute. I think it's really easy if we don't merge them before-hand, but if we let them if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment, because then we can easily display them individually, contrast them to each other and play around with how to combine them. Try. Mm-hmm. And also we don't have to recalculate if just one Okay. Exactly. Yeah. And computationally multiplying two integers or doubles or whatever shouldn't be the thing that slows us down. If it's already on segments base, that's not too much. Yeah. Alright. Right.",
