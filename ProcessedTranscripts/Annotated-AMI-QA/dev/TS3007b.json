    "displayText": "Hello. Hey guys. Hi. Hi. Hi. See my bunny is still standing. Yeah. No one drawing it. It's too beautiful. True. I figured that much. Too wicked. Mm. A minute please, my laptop there it is, thank you. So welcome back. At the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you, not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour. I will take minutes and will put the minutes that I have at the end of the session in the shared folder. Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now, so you can read that now or afterwards. I had an email from the management board I don't know if you also received it, but there were four points which I think are very important. First one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus. Second one is also important because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session. The remote control should only be used for the television, so not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control, so that's one thing to keep in mind. Second, and I think that's important for the Marketing Expert, the current customers are in the age group group of forty years and older, but with this new remote they would like to reach a group younger than forty. And I think to keep in mind, but not really for now is that they want the the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote. So, we have forty minutes, so I think not more than ten minutes per presentation each, and please use all the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards, the Word files, whatever you want. So Tim, can you start? Okay. Yeah? Kay, welcome. I have some new findings on Marketing Expert level, which I will show you. Mm-hmm. The method I used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire. One hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results. These were a couple of findings, first page of three. We have three audiences of two audiences, I'm sorry. The first one, this scale, from sixteen to forty five age. The second one is from forty six to sixty five. As you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five. Second audience audience is thirty five percent. Mm and some interests from the age groups, it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology stuff, like an LCD screen on the remote control, speech recognition. I don't think that's really appropriate. And when you see the audience, the age is going up they don't really want it anymore, at least the new technologies. Second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinions of the audience about current remote controls. First point is, seventy five percent of the users find the most remote controls very ugly, and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. So that's maybe something for the User Interface Designer. Okay, third findings. According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation, following buttons are most important. I will tell something about the way this test was, done. Persons were asked they use most, how much an hour, and in the second table the importance of those buttons. Mm-hmm. When you multiply them, you get these three points. Switching channels, pretty normal, that's what you do with a remote control. The second, teletext, and the third, volume controls. I think it's good that we know what the user wants, at least these three points have to be very clear. But it's strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet. Okay. So that that's strange. Okay, but at the moment teletext is the best thing you can get on TV, like getting information. Okay. So when you ask people, what do they use, they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's ridiculous. Yeah. That's a it It's a new technology, but it's not incorporated right now. Yeah. Okay, my personal preferences. I think we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five. Mm, first of all it's the biggest audience, sixty five percent. Second, I think you will get the most revenue from it. People from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of TV, more than people who are elder. Second point, we have to improve the most used functions, as I said here, switching channels, teletext and volume controls. Third point that came out of the questionnaire, people used to get lost off the remote controller, so maybe it's an idea for us to design kind of placeholder on side of the, TV where you can put the remote control in. That's a cool idea. That's about it, I think. Yeah. When you mentioned improving functions, what do you mean by that what are you think about? Not the not the functions, but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control. The funtionability. So you can have a remote control full of buttons, a hundreds hundreds of buttons, but if you don't use them, they have to be on it just to get it done if necessary, but the most used buttons have to be bigger or perhaps. Yeah. Ah okay, so focusing more on the used buttons. Yeah. Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions, like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example. Just for the minor functions perhaps. Thank you. Perhaps, just an idea. Just to get less buttons on the remote control, to make it easier and quicker to learn. Yeah. Yeah? Kay, that's it. Thank you, Tim. I'll go, sure. Janus, can you Okay, thank you Janus. Right I'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project. What I did was I dissected current remote controls and I viewed how they looked, how they worked, what kind of components are involved, and how they are connected together. And after that I put up a scheme about how these things are organised and I'll show it to you in a in a few seconds. And I'll explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why I think several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off. Right. What I did was I checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared, not like all probably know. And the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a TV or a stereo or something, and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared, so if we want to build mm a remote control with Bluetooth for instance then the TV should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate, so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that wouldn't mean a cheap remote control for us. So that's probably why most controls are still infrared. Furthermore they all have a very simple structure, so that would probably mean lower costs and that could mean for us a good thing 'cause we should be able to build a cheap remote. As I mentioned ready, we have some Bluetooth it may be possible, but I figured it wouldn't be possible within our budget, but that's not for me to decide, but that's maybe something for marketing to look into. Because my personal opinion is not to do Bluetooth or radio waves, although actually I have. What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place-holder next to the TV, connected to the TV? So it's in the wrong product. Actually I figured that would be rather nice, but then you'd still have the infrared function. So in theory you'd actually just move the problem, but what I did think about was when you mentioned about the cup-holder, is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote. Yeah. Yeah. If somebody says, where is the remote, then it goes beep beep beep or something, dunno, maybe something to look into, dunno what the cost that something like that would be. Yeah. But it may be something to explore. I'll just explain a bit of the components. First you have the energy source. The energy source would be a simple battery that you can find anywhere. I figured that would be best, 'cause when the battery stops functioning use you could just go out and buy a new one. And we don't have to do all to be too complicated about that. The energy source is connected to the infrared button, but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these. This case it switches a button, when a button is pushed in, a electric current goes through here, and immediately, a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened. That's so the user won't be thinking, did the button be pressed, what happened. Or I press button but nothing's happening on the TV, so is is something wrong or something. So that's just to to explain to to make it clearer to the user. The signal goes via chip that's translated into electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end. And those interpreted by the device, in this case the television. My personal preferences here, we have to keep it simple. Not too many gadgets and functions, just like you said the most users you have a lot of buttons and you don't use them, so why should we spend more time on those. I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving. So no input from the television. So I think we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and things like that, because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too, and so in order to receive the signals from what's on TV and such. So I figure that would be spending too much money and time and Yes, but what should I I I agree with you, but should we spend money and time on building a receiver into the remote control? Maybe another problem I think current TVs can even send infrared. Huh. Mm-hmm. Cause that would be extra components, extra designs, larger remote control. Yeah. Yeah. All all stuff that we have to take in account. So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. We should look into the design and the functionability. Yeah. Like I said, use one button for instance for multiple functions, or just hide the few buttons of switching it open or something, the usual stuff. And don't overbuild, we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions, but we should stick to the basics. So that was my personal opinion. And that was my presentation but. Okay. Yes, I can go ahead. You do? The last presentation. Last presentation. You have plenty of time, Tim and Janus don't talk to ten minutes, so take your time. Okay. If you take your time too long I will eventually warn you. I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions. What's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design, technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one, so if you going to design a remote that looks good, that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make, of course, but also the user friendliness, that's some of the main points. And another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult, so use as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote. If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons to be shown at the same time, 'cause when you visit an internet site you don't want fifty links to see, but maybe use a hierarchy structure. Hmm. And one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen, don't in how far that is possible, since we are sticking to infrared and the remote cannot receive anything, but we might consider that. Hmm. Of course I hope this is all clear to you. If you can use remote like this with all the functions, many functions, your thumb is a little bigger than it than this. You have to be very careful what you push, and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour from where is it? Where the hell here guess and, when you have to use something else. So just keep it simple, make clear buttons, easy to use. For example if you want to use a play and back and stop, that's very important. This was because of our last discussion, if multiple machines are used, create easy switch between the machines, but it's no longer applying. I prefer to use it only for TV and not to give too many options and if possible, the buttons should give a direct action, not first select and so that's where the difficulties lie. You just said you wanted to combine more functions in one, so you want to keep it simple, but I think that if you want to do that, then you can't escape the fact that there will be buttons which give more options than one. This so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other. But you have to keep in mind that several TVs don't even have a menu structure, or they have a very simple menu structure, so you have to keep in mind that not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions. Do we want to use a few options and might not be so original, or multi-purpose as we thought, or do we want to use many buttons. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So weighing those factors. It's maybe an option if you use an LCD or a touch screen that in the middle are the main keys, displayed on the. The doesn't. This? No? Yeah. Something like that. Okay, just in the middle the general functions, like play, channel switching, and then at the top or at the bottom, some menus like settings or that you can drop down. Yeah. But when all the questions I had Do we want to use a menu display on the TV? Or does have to everything be in remotes? Cause if you use a memory display on the TV, you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay. Mm. So that's my recommendation, if you use many options in one buttle button, display the menu on the TV and don't use combination of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds, is too complicated for most users. Nah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too, and that's partly because a lot of TVs have different menus, and when you have a particular menu at your device, it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on TV. That will be a problem. Yeah. Yes. And that would be a considerable problem. So if we have to stick with current technologies and the restrictions of. Yeah. Use big clear buttons. Not too many. So maybe we'll loose a few options, but I think this is more important. Especially the important buttons, if you want to switch channel, change your volume, use teletext, it has to work at once and more advanced options may put it somewhere away on the remote, behind a little thing or a touch screen. But then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up or something. And if you want to put on stand-by or change the channel, that should always be possible to do. Not first change menu options or switch something. Yeah. As you already told, give some feedback. Yeah. If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low. And my conclusion is less is more, keep it simple. So maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on because you all know, if there are a lot of function on the television, you'll never know and never use, and therefore it's important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the most important functions. Yeah. Yeah. I think the idea about touch screen is very good. Because recently I saw news item on TV about new telephones for elder people. They have a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up, and that's a big advantage because the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something. Mm-hmm. It's very visual intended. What was I to say more? Maybe that's an option. Keep the primary buttons visible. Yeah. Make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form. But the important buttons make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen, or if that's will become too difficult like some older telephones use a maybe it's possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible. Okay, but if you pick the idea, the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen? The extra functions. The extra functions, you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions, and you just choose one, and then all the options will become available and you just scroll through them. But menu functions or Ah okay. Yeah. Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen, one small touch screen applet and I'll just make let's say fifteen buttons on it, and we have three of those, actually just menus with sub-menus, with or sub-items, sub-functions. I think so. Yeah. Then I'd like to make a proposal. If you make one big touch screen, use the same concept as here, keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Like the iPod idea that we just saw. Yeah. Yeah. You just have a few selected buttons and a few menus, and with this idea several you can also improve later on. Yes. I think that will be great. Okay. So you think it's will be better to have a kinda total touch screen. I think so. I would actually go for the. Jirun? Okay, I agree, but I think it's very important that they always make the same buttons accessible, so use just for special options a part of the touch screen. Of course. Yeah. And so an elder designer of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions, you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the TV or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions. Yeah. I had another idea about maybe parental control. Mm-hmm. Building in some kind of PIN code which allows parents to switch to all channels, but if children don't know the PIN code, they can't switch to violent channels or there's just just a simple log-in, something like that. Yeah. Is that possible to use or no? That is possible, that that actually depends on the television, but I think I figure you see the thing is when you buy a remote, you set the channels, the channels are different on each television, they aren't set in a preset order, so if you lock on a remote, let's say channel fifteen, on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television, so that would be that would be actually the main concern. Does it have to depend on the television? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. I think that he means that maybe by some option make sure that remote control and the TV match, and then after that you can insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot change the settings of the TV, like colour and then volume and Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of stuff, but maybe if you log in first as a parent you address the channels and that's channel fifteen, that's violent channel, my kids I don't want my kids to watch that, then you set the priority to only parents, for example. Yes. Something like that. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But make it a separate option in the menu, so that it's displayed here, so parents you can display it on the old style. That would that. Okay, but but that's an added feature. Yeah. Okay. But let's not go too wide about those things, that why we're here. Those things are nice. It's it's a nice idea, but I think that's later in the stage. I've one little question about a total touch screen or a partial, because I think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen, so they want the the normal functions like teletext, volume changing, to be kinda traditionals and the the the other functions, the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen, but to keep this as normal as possible, to keep it accessible. Partial. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But if you display it on LCD screen with really big numbers that's just as easy. Uh. I do I do agree, because it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button, but we have to look at what's our target audience. You can display actual buttons on the touch screens. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Okay. It's different. We are aiming for younger people and they chose So that's probably a But they they all have to be programmed to fit your TV and that is bit of a tricky job. Yeah. That's true. Age below forty. That's a good point. Yep. And those young people. You saw it in my marketing report, they like the new fancy stuff, so A touch screen, like Microsoft already developed something like that for multi-media applications. Mm-hmm. They like the fancy stuff. That's true. Mm-hmm. Mm. I I think we can do that too. Okay, as you can see the minutes from the second meeting, this one, are done. Done. I've added this four things from the management board just to keep in mind. Mm-hmm. Each time I had a sort of summary on what you told and what you personal think. So that can be read out. A few things I noticed were Moment. Ooh. The main points this in this meeting is I think how it's going to look with we must keep it simple, but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden or something, so you don't have a big thing full of buttons and the point that you wanna use one controller hypothetically each television, so you must the the functions, know, like the menus or the parental control must be all done by the remote control and not by the television. I think that's the point what we discussed. Mm-hmm. Yes. Some of them. The menus are not identical for all TVs, so you have to display it on one TV. You can use how do you call it, synchronized, the remote and the TV, then there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda TV it is, from ah, it's a Philips, this and this and that, and then give the options that are capable the capable from the there are universal remotes and they all have a functionality for all the TVs, so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the menus of these. But that's not possible. Mm-hmm, mm. An but you have an international market range, so you have a big range of. Add that that's an opportunity. Yeah. Okay. But No. And it's not too complex to do it. Yeah. Yeah. I actually use one of those when They are kinda kinda troublesome, but the thing is when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the remotes, because in order for the remote to process something from the TV, to synchronise and you have to send and receive, and that's. Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, you can just say the. No no no. Just build it in. He he he he he means just just one other thing. With the current remote controls, the universal ones, you have to press a code for TV. Yes. In codes, you you get a a book with codes. I have a Philips H fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five in the remote and it displays all your menu options. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, sure. Sure, that would be possible. Yeah. Now we just connect the TV type to a set of options, just just in the memory, so that profile, so that if you touch in one four one zero kind of TV the memory pops up the options. Memory in the in the remote. Yep. Profiles. Yeah. Yeah. That would be possible. Okay. Sure. I don't think that takes a lot of storage space or just variables. No, that wouldn't be a few variables. If you look at the manuals from universal remotes, there are maybe three four hundreds TVs at maximum. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. If you have all of them, all the old and new TVs summed up, I think it is possible. Ah it is. It is definitely firmware upgrade. But, on the other hand if you have a remote and buy a new TV that isn't incorporated in the New remote? We have five minutes to go. Yeah. Then you have to buy a new one, it's very good for marketing Maybe, or an software update. A firmware upgrade or something, but from where? Firmware update, you say. Ah. Maybe No no, maybe we can incorporate some kind of USB or a firewire connection, so that you can connect it to the PC and download the newest firmware from the internet. That's maybe the cup holder. Yeah. Yeah. Not everybody has a PC at home. Most people have, but not everybody and. You can go back to the shop they and they can download it for you. A kind of service centre. Maybe something like service Or you could actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier, and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Already digital information is sent to the standards, TV connections, you can see what's programme is on the new channels, so maybe we can send that information along with standard TV Receiving. Yeah. Then it's be back to the building a receiving if it's actually worth it to build it in, we could actually look into it, but I dunno, it would be bringing more costs with it and that would be probably best. Yeah. Yeah. Difficult. Yeah. I think it's most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop. I think it's good idea. Yeah. When you buy a TV you just ask I'll. It's it's not a lot of work, just one docking station where you put it in, press start, bling updated. That would be best. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't buy a TV every week, new so. Okay, let's save this in the meanwhile for which one are we going? No no. Exactly, so my vote goes out to the right. My mistake. Let's vote. That one or Your vote and your Okay. My vote too. Yeah. And your vote? I was doubting about which one to take, but you've convinced me that if you display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will know what to do. Yeah. Yeah. And also a clapping device that pops open. Opens up is too difficult or Break it, I don't get so. Flips open. Too difficult, maybe it's easier to break it. Yeah. That. It's very sensitive. My telephone, it's sensitive too. Yeah. Yeah. Okay it's almost at the end. So we have now a lunch break, finally. Ah. After the lunch break it's back to individual work, once again thirty minutes. I have updated them so they're updated in the shared folder too. Thirty minutes? Thirty minutes, the Failure. How minutes? The specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the email. I don't think I can say much about it, so wait for your email and hopefully you get it done in the thirty minutes, and I will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes. One question, how late do we have to be back here? Yeah? Thirty minutes. A quarter to one maybe? Thirty minutes lunch break? Thirty minutes lunch break. Okay. I thought forty five. Oh. Forty five? Yeah. Then would it be one o'clock. Yeah. Or we we ask our personal coach. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, that was a very good session we because all things are stored in smart board dot XDK and that's in No. Is it possible to store this on the share documents or what 'Kay, save it as an image on the No, and use an image if possible. Me too. Save as. But you can open from your laptop. Maybe. Save as. Export. No. Maybe not export function. Export. I can You all have the questionnaire again after work. Export HTML. Image? J PEG. G J PEG. J PEG. It's better. Paper size A four. Screen size. In this directory. Oh. It's not connected to our PCs. No? It is connected. It's connected? I think so. To room. Huh. No. I'll just saved in my documents. Oh. In my own messenger. Yeah. Project documents. Yeah. It gives the. Yes. Okay, nice. Okay, thank you. We fill out after lunch or Okay. It's simply filling no, it's it's also filling out no, I'd do it after lunch I think. I'm hungry, so do it after lunch. Aye, cheers. Yes. Thank you all. Thank you. You're welcome. We can leave the PC on and return to the bring to I gotta bring it home. Of course. Yeah. I bring it to my personal room. To my executive Aye. My executive big room with the panting. A big office.
