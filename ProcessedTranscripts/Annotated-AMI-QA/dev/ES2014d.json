You have to close that window. Cause that's the save one isn't it, so And then find it. But right, I'll just re-do it. That's the easiest way. Right. We've made our prototype anyway. We can have a good look at that. You pass it round to have a look. Mm-hmm. No, it's slightly curved around the sides. Mm very nice. It's almost curved up to the main display as well. Mm-hmm. And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. Mm-hmm. And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on. Mm-hmm. We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. So it is. Cherry would be alright actually. Yeah. It's a bit more fun, isn't it? And it's kinda not really at a kind of computers, like Apple Mac. We might get For the M. Mm-hmm. Copyright. What's this this one? And cherries are fun, summery. What's that one there? Ah, that's the mute. Okay. Right. It it'd probably have to be labelled mute. Uh-huh. But we didn't have anything small enough to write. They're thinking For the first time, it was hard to get the actual labelling on the individual buttons. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We just chose simple shapes for all them. The important ones are the volume ones. So we made them a bit bigger. Mm-hmm. The mute could possibly be a bit smaller. Hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you've got the volume in orange on design there, and the channel is in blue. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. And we chose a V plus and V minus. All these things have cost implications. And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button. So However, I've now. So but there would be a cost implication on that, as suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours, would be open to debate, I suppose. I'll see if I can find them. Yes, we'll have the slide-away. That's they wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white Play-Doh. Have Mm-hmm. So that's where the colour buttons came from. An important consideration. Right, okay And the second one underneath would be the idea for the Right, okay. Bottom. So we've got detail design meeting. Right. So we've got prototype presentation, which we've just done, evaluation criteria, and finance, so I guess we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting. So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer, but obviously obviously it would. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But other than that, we got the red apple. We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the colouration of the buttons, and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance. Yes, yes. Right. Okay. And the and the cost implication. The only snag about this is that the cost is probably kind of important. And then the production evaluation, as to how easy that would be to manufacture. Mm-hmm. And Right, so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half Euros. So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype? That's it. This is a yes, this is our presentation of the prototype. That's the Okay. Mm-hmm. So, there's no redesign. So that should Right, so, seems to me that the thing that I have to do is quickly find that Right. Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there? We should plug it in. Do you wanna do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one. Okay. Kay, Alice. So, 'Kay this should be then. We could do it as we go along, the production costs, looking at the prototype. Right. Okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber case materials supplements. So, we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and Okay. Mm-hmm. Have a push button interface. The button supplements. Originally, I thought there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple. But So the so the real the real question then would come in. Do you make all the buttons so we've got one special button form, which was the apple. We'll do it on the prototype, so do two, see how much it is. Everything else is gonna be a standard. Yeah. And then we'd have So that's nine point one there so we've got some 'Kay. We've got special material, rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera and that, so, I was originally, I was thinking rubber wasn't special, but according to this, maybe it is. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there. Yeah. I think you just do one, don't you, for the I think I think it's just it's just a one. I don't know is is the sort of answer, is that meant to be all sixteen buttons, and therefore what's the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons, but just to have the one that was soft and spongy, and therefore Whereas the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber, whereas the rest would be hard plastic. Else I I think I think the button supplement is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material, rather than per button. Mm. I don't know though. Every design change is dunno, Okay, if we just had all the buttons as standard, except for the one red apple, then that would take care of that, I guess. Hmm. We'd have one special colour and one special button form. Mm-hmm. And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half. As far as I know, that that took care of the various supplements. Mm-hmm. And if What happened? You've just gone off the window into another one. It's on the bottom row. Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box. Yeah. Now, right. Okay, but the point would be that if we just did special Sorry, you were saying that it would be that one, that you would put in one there. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So is it is no, it's nine point seven I've got. Mm-hmm. Okay. Just give us a bit of I switching around those on the electronics we got the sample sensor. So, that would work out fine if assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons, then that would be fine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we had planned to put on. Um. At the moment we've just got the simple chip, which costs one. I guess the sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing, which puts up to four? Uh-huh. Yeah. We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard, and maybe go with the special form buttons, then we could have the speech So maybe if we got rid of the maybe one of the special colours, kept them all the same colour, then we could have the voice recognition without. Yeah. Hold on. Okay, that gives us twelve point seven But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the I see, so just take out the special colour for the apple and go for battery instead. Wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well? Possibly, maybe. You know how you turn that one to a zero, wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things, so you need both of them? We have to have it. Maybe we'd be giving up on the kinetic. That would save us one, though we'd still be slightly. Yeah. That would give you one less. But you reckon that the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and not have to replace batteries. Since it's through the whole technology type thing, you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them. Mm-hmm. Whether they would figure the sample senor and the sample speaker, voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have. And then still have the batteries, or whatever they would prefer not what? Mm-hmm. The problem was the battery's running out and losing the remote. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them. But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options? I think the voice recognition. In a sense, at the moment, we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two. At least. Remember that was a minimum requirement. The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful, would be to make it originally, we're gonna make it a simple product. Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first, and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Makes sense. Okay. Okay. Right I have a little thing. So, we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven, isn't it, with everything we want on. Sorry, do you want that back up? I just had a presentation to do. Right. But I do think the voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery. Okay, but remember the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right okay This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we've got here. And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype, and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research, and also finance, I guess. And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven, so if it's neither true nor false, then that's four. So, I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end. So, We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. Whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. Whether it's easy to use. Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product. And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently, so I'll go over here. Okay. Right. So the first one does the product look and feel fancy. So if we do sort of a one So. Okay, we have a single curve, which was maybe the feel of the product's quite good. So then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was at the time. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry that'd be considered fancy. Yeah. I'd maybe give it a two. Of but I think What Is one false, or is one true? I forgot. One's true. One's true, and okay. Four is neutral, okay. And a four is neutral. So Right. So maybe maybe a two. cause we haven't got the double curve, so we can't say it's completely true. Go for one. But it's pretty close. Yep. We've got almost everything we can. Okay. Okay. Right. I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space. So, false is seven, true is one, and So say about a two for fancy, you think? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Why not maybe nearer three. Okay, you do an average at the end, I don't know. Two three. Uh-huh. It's just that saying something remember that when you look down, we've got various other things you could have, and we're not going for these options. This is just this is just for the look. Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional. Mm-hmm. So that so should we go for a two on that? I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit. Okay. Kay. And how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon? Deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition, and if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. Yeah. Okay. So, what about the The prototype as it is, we've got we've got the speech recognition on it, haven't we. But not the kinetic. But not the kinetic. Like the power. No. Cause you can't afford that we took that out too. No, we we can't afford both. Alright, so It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of fulfilling the Okay. Didn't you? Or wait a minute. No is maybe about neutral plus it it's got something, but it hasn't got Right. Maybe a three. Yeah. In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic. I would give it more than a four. The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five. Okay. And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic. So, it's very much dependant on what you do with your options. Right, okay. And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker, then because that the other functions we've got in are more at the special material, the rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera, if you go for that, that's at the high end 'cause that's point six, whereas down at just special colours is point two. Kay. Now you're trying to lose one point two, so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker, you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else. Mm-hmm. Okay. And the simple way to do it would be to have a battery, to have your sample sensor speaker, and then you're looking to take out point two, which would come from the button supplements category. Mm-hmm. I'm just gonna check my email. I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product. How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much. If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. And then it stand the test of time better. Interface type plastic rather than rubber. Okay. But I Okay. That that that would make the significant difference. You could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber, then that would enable you could keep kinetic then, you could keep your sample sensor, and you'd be looking to take out point two. So you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom, or your special colour at the bottom. Mm-hmm. And that would enable you to to do it. So it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, and if we make it more innovative innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but It's rubber as it is, yes. I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is, I think, so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design. I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or. I suppose it's rubber as it is, isn't it. So, does this need to go up a bit or something, 'cause we've got both the speech. We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically, we're going to reduce down from that. Yeah. But the current one, you'd say would be fancy, would be too Mm-hmm. Yeah. For innovation, so we've got the speech thing, and Do you reckon a two? I would've said about a two as well. Two or three. I'd be happy with a two. Okay. Oh. Two. And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now. I can just sing about. Easy to use. I would've said yes. I would go for a one on that at this point in time. Yeah. Okay. I would say so as well. Incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. It certainly has some. It does. It's got the cherry and the sponginess. Say about a three maybe? Yep. I don't know. It was just doing it quite well. Maybe two? I think we're gonna have to lose some of these, but the moment, as it stands, it's the sensor using all of its products, all of its buttons, and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. Yep. I woulda said two would seem reasonable. It's a two. The product is a recognisable real reaction product? This is This. That's a bit rough at the minute. So this is about sort of the corporate image of new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing, as well as having the logo on and all that. Oh. Okay. So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product. Does it fit in with our other products, which are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft. It's got the same speech feature as the coffee machine. What do. Okay. Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age. It depends which way you look at it. Uh-huh. So we're going for a two, three? So Two or three? Maybe a kind of three? So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has. Two or three. The logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing. It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper. Sure. But I think the logo would definitely be recognisable. Yeah. And it does have attributes that other products do. Two? Aye. Go for it. Right, okay. Two or three. Two. How Two. Right, come on. That's that decided. Okay. Right. So So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements, and then About a two. Right. Yeah. What does what do all them numbers mean then? Do we add them up and rate or anything? I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head. Two. One point eight isn't it or something. I think, anyway. So pretty close to a two. So it's pretty good at the moment, but it's gonna get worse, isn't it. But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad. Yep. Two. Yes. Yeah. Okay, so I guess this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it? You can lose one point two and still meet the requirements. Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances I'm not sure. Okay, I put it back on. We'll probably have to re-rate it. Yes, I would've thought so. We'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going. Yeah. Okay, so what was it, control F eight, wasn't it? Ah it's on. It's come on already. Oh. Oh. How kind. Right, okay. So, you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic, right, you've got a choice there of going down to battery, which would save you one. You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker, which is your big item. Actually then we lose two points, which gets us right within the budget range. That's right. Mm. Which gets you Yes. I think that'd be fine. Because that was just a trend, and we do have rubber buttons anyway. So that's eleven point seven, and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. Yeah. Different colours. Alright. I was thinking that because maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of sleeker plastic case. Possibly. And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations. Yeah. Okay, so we're going for plastic, yes? So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of and that's that's within the budget. Lose a little bit on the fashion, And then. Yep. Do we just have one special forms down here? There was debate as to how you would count them. And we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left, so we've got enough for another But but but I think maybe the special colour, we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different, I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour. You got special colour. Originally I was assuming we had the red apple, and therefore, that was the special colour. I think we should just imagine white buttons. We've got special form. Now that would be one button, and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button. Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that, that would be the same. The other thing would then be special material, rubber, wood, titanium. Yeah. Alright. So, special colour, you want three in there. Which I think they'll still be fine for the price. Okay. I think you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements. One original colour and then sort of two supplements, maybe. That makes sense. Okay, that's probably it. Okay. Yeah. So we only we only need two for that. Okay. Cause these are moulded. The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of rubber, isn't it. Okay. I would agree with that, I think. So special colours, two. Right. And we've got special form is the one apple. The rest are all standard, although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom, I was presuming, bigger than the other ones, or were you? Maybe that'll be a second supplement. Was that the idea? The volume ones should stand out a bit. That. Then there's a a second special form. Uh-huh. I would have thought that's probably about. You got twelve. Okay, so shall we do a. So I think that should still be okay. That's twelve point three, so we're still within budget on that. Right. Yep, that makes sense. So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it, but generally speaking, we've kept the other attributes That's without. Yep. I woulda said so. Yeah. So you'd maybe put fashion at three rather than two. And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name? Real Reactions? Real Reaction I'm not quite sure, what does that mean? Yeah. It still seems definitely fit that so that's like if that's the new age kind of innovative type company, then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is quite high up on Mm-hmm. So it's if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. Yep of you could argue you might do it once a year, you would change, because at the moment you're making a red apple. We got a cherry one. Maybe other ones could be something else shaped. I don't know. That would be seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got, we've made it a special form, And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. And it would sort of, keep it quite fancy as well, don't. So it's Whatever fruit was in fashion next year. You could. So next year you could make next year's model the same, but have it as a whatever, a lemon. A lemon lemon or something. The volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe. And that amount the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it? Okay. So, we've what have we what have we rid of. We got rid of the plastic. Is it The rubber. That was that was just about all. Ease has certainly stayed. Yeah. I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface, which is by far the cheapest. Yeah. So maybe in a sense not having that, maybe we've maybe lost something on the innovation side? So we got rid of the rubber case, but we now sort of got an extra form, and an extra colour for the buttons. I dunno. And that is the most standard type of button. So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability, we're pretty much the same, maybe. Yeah. So, we could maybe put two again on them. And everything else has stayed pretty much the same, plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what about the sort of innovation? We've still got the kinetic energy. Do you think Okay. The speech feature. And the speech feature. And then, the corporate identity. I think we've cut just about the same. We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect But I think more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics, but either way, I think we've made it fairly close to what just the the company logo. How it would play out. Yeah. Oh. Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity, I don't know. It's maybe not. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, We Mm-hmm. I don't see how we could make it any more. Apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue, like the casing. But then what colour would you make the Rs? So maybe there's a set design which we get printed off. But you've got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stick-on badge. Yeah. Okay. So you're in a sense, you're comparing the product without the company logo. Yeah. And then but you've got the space for it to stick it on. Hey, what what's the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or right. I'm still not quite sure we've established that. No, We got the logo off the web browser. Don't think so. But but in the sense that, as you saw with the Windows logo badge, it doesn't really matter. The Windows badge on there, it really doesn't matter what colour it is, so long as our company's logo is framed in the same way as that with a black outline. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Fact, they've got black and white or black and silver. So basically, even if you had the same colour of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product. Mm. And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it. Okay. Uh-huh. Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. In this one, you've actually got three colours of buttons. Another colour. Or would that be. We decided that the blue ones were the standard colour. Okay. So you were talking about We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel, the hidden away panel, would all be standard. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Which may or may not be the case. Yeah. Shall we save the point two for profitability then? Maybe for the one they're gonna see all the time, we make it look good, and fit the kind of idea of what they want. But was there not a button that you were thinking of on the other on the second page, as it were, that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour? I don't think they would really need to be. I think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine. Needs to be an enter button, but could just be the same as well. Hmm. And then for the more functional buttons, we don't worry too much about that and just have that as a plus it's hidden away anyway, you're not gonna see it at the start. Yeah. It's the sort of thing that, you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume. Alright. So, if it's dead obvious, then that's fine. But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning, then you're paying a bit more attention. So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important. Okay. Cause you. Yeah. So we just add that to profitability in effect. So we've dropped the cost, but Same sort of function? Mm-hmm. Right, so we're meant to finish up in five minutes. The criteria? It's alright. Kay. Just made a load of money. Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion, go to a three? Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel. Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all. But I think we said that Because you got rid of the rubber, we put an extra sort of fruit shape on one of the buttons. Alright. I think we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something. Did we decide what that was, which button it was? On the volume ones? Right. Uh. Or something like that. That's good. Yeah. Definitely lemon shaped. Did did you have to have a rubber case, though, for rubber buttons? Or was it the other way around? You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case. Right, okay. Mm-hmm. So I think we can we're okay. So we're okay this way around. Yeah. So that so we've saved Saved two Euros on that. Until the design team comes in and says, get off. But you are the design team. Then we say it's fine, so it's all good. What bit are we on to? Can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac? And did we make it a cherry officially? Yeah. I. Mm-hmm. Right. Right, okay. Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such. Drats, I've botched that, haven't I. Were we aiming for a certain target on that scale? We're aiming one for all of them. But it really has to fit into the budget, so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it in the Which is fair enough. Right. And we seem to have least something in each criteria. Yeah. We haven't completely left anything out, so As an overall product which has to be quite cheap, we've just about achieved everything. I think most. Yep. So do we have anything else to discuss? I don't know. What's on the agenda? Right, okay What's happened here? Right, okay Mm. Right, okay Right. So we got So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign. We've got the closing. So we're now on to project process. Now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. So, we're actually now in a sense, on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is my understanding of it. Uh-huh. So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain. So, I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do. Finish your meeting now. We should just go through this quickly and then. Huh. Yeah. Okay. So, I think I have to finish that page. Oh. Right, okay, so Project evaluation. So, Creativity. Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? Yeah. Individual meetings. Yeah. I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. How do you mean? Yeah. We were finding out various things in in-between the meetings, and the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons, and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. In on your own. Mm, The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, normally, you go to a meeting, you decide, right, you do that. You'd probably present it at one or something like that. Yeah. Then you go away. You find out information. You then come back. You then discuss it. You then go and change things around, and then go back. Uh-huh. Yeah. Whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, so it's not Anyway, what do you want to put down? I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant. Yeah. Yeah. I've put, seemed okay. Creativity, seemed okay. Flow of information on any given subject given subject sometimes disjointed. Yeah. I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. A remote control isn't the most kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. The thing itself. Could have used a different example to create Creativity. I can't think of a better example at the minute. Yeah. Yeah. Is this go It kinda fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on. Mm-hmm. You have to do it within a set time frame But the other thing is that I'm guessing that they're trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project. Yeah. But think it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way. It depends what sort of business you're in, I guess. This one seems. From the website it's quite innovative, but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's, fifteen quid. One of those things. Companies can have a range of products and I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have a brief to kind of. My wife at the moment, for instance, is acting as a computer for you normally, you got a problem, so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question. Or the idea is that whichever person's at the other end can point them in the right direction, show them where to either give them directly give them help, or secondly, point them in the right direction, either at the library, or or come back, or go and see Joe Bloggs, or whatever. And that was a project suspect similar to this, because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work. And of course, you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong. Hmm. We look at the last slide, see if it's got anything else. Mm-hmm. Alright, so we've got New ideas found, did we find any, no. I think there's one one more to go. Yeah. If you look at their products on their website here, Real Reaction, it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge. And. It was quite good with the white board, having that and the digital pens. That's something that made it a little easier. Alright. Yeah. Leadership, teamwork. We did find a new idea, sort of a kinetic remote control. I've never seen one of them before. Batteries, I think. So Mm. Does You've got voice recognition computers, that's not remote controls. Voice recognition, especially not could. Yeah. It's a different application of it. Mm-hmm. So it's just the same products, but just put together in a different way. Okay, how do you reckon teamwork went? Mm. I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. That went okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. To go reasonably well. Okay. Allowed us to do anything I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products. Bit bit arbitrary. They've got all these sort of, high definition DVD and portable seven inch lightweight computer screens, and I'm thinking, do you know, one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in. Mm-hmm. Surely they should. So, we're we're meant to comment on leadership and the means, E G whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. Leadership's a bit of a funny one, isn't it. And and new new ideas found was the the other thing. But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager. You were the leader. So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours. Yeah. Yeah. Now, I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this computer to work as well as I would have liked. However, Alright means, so whiteboard so really, it's equipment. Oh. Yeah. It worked. Very nice. Computers could be a bit difficult at times but there's a little there's a little There's a little chip, I think you must plug it into something and it produces a don't. But I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these. They record what you're writing, and then what do you do with it? Where do you get the recording? Do you plug the computer or something? So it's not just for us, it's for the experiment as a whole, so Should we quickly look at the last slide? Right. I think you watch a video of it kind of. Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something, and Page after page. Right. New ideas found, so one or two. Yeah. Kinetic powered remote control. What was the other one? Voice recognition thing. Yeah. And was it voice activated recognition. Voice recognition. Almost. To fill in these questionnaires no. Pretty much. Right, so, are the costs within budget, yes. Is the project evaluated, yes. Don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. Then celebration. Is that everything? Hmm? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting. Yeah. So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three, and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere.",
