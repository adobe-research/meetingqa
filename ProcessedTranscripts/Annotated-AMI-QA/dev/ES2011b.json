    "displayText": "Okay. Kay so we'll try to zip through this, since we're short on time. Welcome everybody. Hope your sessions went well. So this is our functional design meeting, we're going to consider user needs, technical effects, and the working design of our remote control. I've been taking meetings on the minutes on the meetings, and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there. I'll get the ones up for next time, they're not finished yet. Right. So can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure. And I can start if you want. Mm. Is there an order? No. We haven't decided on an order. Hm? No, any any order's fine. First. Okay. Yeah. I'll just put the cable in. Just You may need to But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three setting cycle, so press it a couple times, hold down function and then press F eight. Sorry. Is that it? Can you see? Here. Okay. So what happens it doesn't work? It it takes a few seconds I think. Who's that? No. Is it in the right thing? Wait. Uh. You need to help me. Uh-huh, and then press function. Yeah. And F eight. Could you just plug it back into hers because she had. Wait. That's is that it? Adjusting. Here we are. The cable might be a little loose or something. Right here we are. You got it. Oh. Is it on? We're here. Okay. Okay. In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out. The findings in some cases matched what we were talking about. Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons. Easy to lose, and RSI. I don't know what RSI means. The person that did the questionnaire obviously did, I don't have a clue. Hm. According to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour. So and and people like to zap a lot apparently, so this is the order. Channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. The other ones are the settings, and they're used less than zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that I think we could have a button for all the settings, and then, just one, and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television. About the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market, people from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, I don't really know how to describe this, ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing. I don't know what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes more are those like teenagers and young professionals most likely, but we should discuss this together. And that's all I have to say about the matter. Kay. Shall I what do I do? Do I give this to someone else? Yeah. Just move right on. Right. So get this. Okay so now I need to press F eight, what is it? Function F eight. Function F eight. Kay. What's function? It's the one. Function, I see it. There we go. It should be. Okay. Um. My presentation about the technical functions design I basically just tried to focus on just what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. And I just sort of thought about it myself and looked on the internet. And okay so basically I think it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. So I think things like keeping buttons together close together that are used in the same way, or maybe that making 'em the same colour, keeping the number of buttons to a minimum, and also things like is it is it can you small enough large enough I'm not sure guess would need to do some research about, would, about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing, but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV. Does it have capacity to change the channels? Does it do or do we need to have functions for cable or VCR? And then, is it findable, and how do we wanna do that? And I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring, dunno if this will work And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. Just I like the one on the right better, just because it does have fewer buttons, but I think we can sort of think about things like colour and size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user. That concludes my presentation. Okay. You need the little thingy. Ooh. How do I Right. That's on view. Oh. Okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote, and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting. So I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the TV. And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, input which would probably be buttons, although we just talked about voice recognition, processor to take the information, something to transmit it to the TV, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. And also you need a sender for location signal, which would probably be a separate thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. The battery, goes to the chip, and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the TV. And then for the location function, you would have a sender on the TV which would output some sort of signal, we could use IR but we'd probably wanna use radio instead. That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it, and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up. So my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be battery for the energy source, that way wouldn't have to plug it in, a button pad for input, we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff, IR transmitter to communicate to the TV, that's just sort of standard, so most TVs have an IR receiver. Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. So that concludes my presentation. Kay. Do you know about I dunno, you seem about Okay. Mm? I was an engineer before I came here. Cool. Okay. Thank you everybody. We'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in. Teletext is apparently outdated, due to internet popularity, so that's off the list. Also our remote should be used only for television, no extra internet kinda fancy things, just the remote and the television. And also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this, so the phrase is, we put fashion in electronics, so let's be fashionable guess. If we have something silver and gold or yellow are our colours, so if we had a kind of silver one like you saw, and yellow writing, something like that. Okay. Um. So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. Let's I guess we should make some kind of brainstorming, see probably our target group and how it's going to appeal to our target group and dunno the the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing. In terms of how it looks, or like what it does? How it looks or the buzzer you mean, for sure. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. So Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? So Okay. I think that seems to. It's easy to implement. Mm. So the. Locator. So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range, what was it? Teenagers and young professionals. That's for speech recognition. Oh. I was thinking about that but speech recognition is really hard to programme, and also, if the TV is on it's making sound and the people on the TV are talking, and if somebody says one, then the TV's gonna switch itself to channel one, or it seems like a. And screen. That's only for speech recognition and screen. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I just put the values in. Yeah. And if if you consider our budget, it probably if you consider our budget, to have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. But the screen is the same as I'm happy with that. It's a cool idea but you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or some place since the TV already has power. Yeah. Yeah. Completely. Yeah. Right so. Okay we'll have the buzzer on the TV itself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You click the button, it's gonna send out a signal, and I was thinking, IR is line of sight, so unless the remote is actually in front of the TV it's not gonna work, so probably a radio signal on a cell phone. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Okay. Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably. Okay. So you'd need a separate base for that or something you can right. It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote. So do you plug it in the T you plug it in TV, this thing? It'd probably just stick it on your TV so if you need to find the remote, click the button. Okay. Okay. So it's now a two-part thing. So it would be a two part package. Okay. Alright. Okay. So we get to design that too. Make it fashionable. Okay. Do you think even though we're not talking about speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals. I think so. Yeah. Huh. Just there. Okay. Mm. Should that thing be on the thing to put you you talking about a home for it. Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now? Yeah. We probably leave that. I guess one takes care of the other, if you can call it then it's. Okay. Yeah. Then it can live anywhere. Okay. Yeah. For the so you have that button, that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio? On the TV or on the phone? Are we just having a radio? On the phone. Seemed the most reasonable to me, I think that's what the phone has, when you need to find your phone, you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever. So. You don't need a light. Yeah. Yeah. And if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so. You can hear it's under the couch. So need the other buttons. So we have this mm. So the two remotes that you had shown don't remember who showed them, you did they're one looked like it was for VCR type thing, and the other looked like just television. Mm-hmm. That was that was me. I think I think they're both sort of just like general they're both general remotes. Really. And. Cause that that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have VCR capabilities. Does anyone know if VCRs are the same across international? They're not no. They're not, no. Okay, so you'd need a whole different set of buttons for everybody's VCRs. That's right. It not VHS here? But DVD probably is. Other than that region and coding thing. But VCRs. And if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, it's gonna be DVD type, that's the technology these days. For sure. Mm-hmm. So. Okay, let's see if I can I think still though, it shouldn't be that hard to just reduce the number of buttons 'cause if you just have one menu button, that works with a or you can just kind of scroll through the options that come up on the TV. Yeah. Yeah. For sure I think we can just design the channels? Power's just a button, and it's not used that much, and it's usually that red I think it's quite nice to keep it like red. Huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen some remotes where if you hold one down it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on. So you don't actually have a separate power button, it's just But It might be confusing. Okay. It seems like that would be hard though. Because unless. Yeah. Just 'cause I would probably pick it up and just be why is there no on button. Yeah. Besides you like to be able to go power. I never think to hold something down. Yeah. I have the power I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So we definitely want a power button and numbers. Yeah. Right. Even iPod thing, I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number, of buttons, instead of having one to nine, have a sort of scrolling I don't know. That sort of joystick flat touch thing. Mm. Yeah. Because now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that you don't have one two three four five it's just and it's one thing which has everything. I think that's an interesting idea, 'cause it's cool, it's funny like I don't have an iPod but I, just started messing around with one of my friend's the other day, and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily, like it's not that hard. Mm. Yeah. And it is. It is really but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then? Can't you if you can have the number on the telly going one two three four five once you scroll and then It's like this like that, and then you do that. You can have the number going around in the corner. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we have this scrolling sort of button. Is that on a mouse pad where kind of okay. A disc. Yeah. Yeah. It's just the same technology as a mouse pad. I've never used one. No. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And then. And then if you actually just want to zap, you can have a thing like that, and that, and then it can just be plus and minus. Okay. So it's a little part of the circle Or it so it's just a region of the circle that you can zap. You can actually click on to have. We could even have four buttons, if that's the mouse, you could have the volume and the channel changers just on that as well. Okay. Yeah. So volume could be the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay. Doesn't it rotate though, so it'll be moving around. You have to be able to change the function of it to okay, 'cause so I dunno, I guess Okay so when you scroll your thumb around it, it'll say you're going clockwise. What do you mean the function? That that means you're gonna go up the channels, and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So if you wanna switch to do you have to switch to a function where so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where it just has the four this is channel that way, that's that way and volume is up and down. But it knows for some reason. It just It just the iPod knows. The iPod knows. Yeah. If it works on an iPod then it works. Huh. So you just can either do this or you can just touch it if you want. I don't have one. For the volume you have to press the middle, and then go up. Okay. That's what I mean. Okay. Okay so you have to press this middle region and then you can scroll up, go up and down. Oh. And then if you do that it goes, but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here, that I've seen. So it's like holding You can And you you is there an extra actual button? Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down. For the iPod you press an right if you're on the channel let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up, and if you do that it goes down. Mm-hmm. I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here, I'm pretty sure. If you're gonna this for channels, right, then wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow? You could just have you could actually. I don't know, you could click and then have it up and down, but I think. Yeah. But the only thing is iPods are so expensive, like, it has to be is that part of I dunno. Is that what makes them I think all of they have so much memory though, it's. I don't think so. You don't think so? I don't think it's the wheel dealy. Okay. I think it. I think it's their it can hold what five thousand songs or something. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking we could if we're So but an iPod just has that circle thing. And they're re-programmable aren't they? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set, that's probably why they're expensive, they're like little computers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Since it just has the circle thing, you could make it a kind of cool shape, like it could be a cool sort of because it could be circular, or something weird like that, just. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It could just be simple instead of being a mass. Because, the other thing, I didn't tell you all my presentation, is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about. Yeah. What other buttons were there? Volume we've just said that. So okay. Channel selection. It's not for or it does need to be compatible with. I A DVD is simple, you just have play, pause, eject, and menu maybe. Actually our new project requirements, I'm not sure if they meant use only for television in not for DVD or just not internet type things. So how do you switch Okay. Menu. So I'll check that and update you on the next But we'll hold off on that 'cause But. So if we had that. But DVD players usually have their own remote. That's true. Yeah. So, I know I'm not really clear on what. But it's cool to have it all on one, because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume, and then you wanna go to the menu, so you don't wanna switch. Mm. Yeah. So I think you would have to have a function switch button, somewhere so like you're either on TV, you're on DVD or you're on VCR, or you're like. Mm. Yeah. But DVD is only four buttons. But so to switch the function of the little circle disc, the touch pad. It is only Okay. But. Oh. But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to DVD really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the TV so you don't have to switch. Let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up. Yes we can try that. Let's see. So everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire, then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.
