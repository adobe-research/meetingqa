    "displayText": "Which data. I want everything and then I'll decide what I want. Yeah. So this was that face to face meeting. Okay. But it doesn't There isn't so there are things in the eye tracker record that we definitely don't want in the GDF format, like the frame rate eye movement. We we're if we're expecting the GDF format to be sort of a parsed version of events. And there's just too much raw frame rate stuff coming out of this. You wouldn't you wouldn't want it in this kind of format for up-translation to the other things. We can get back to it. We can get we can always get back to it. We you can get back to it. We're not actually throwing anything away. Yeah. We're not throwing anything away. And if we decide to re-jig this at some finer method. This is just the stuff. We'll still have the original and a method of filtering. Yeah. But the but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyse against the other tracks of data. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So the data that we wanna compare with a language or with whatever. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So. Okay. As long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalised to a finer take. Because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly. Okay. So whatever we should be able to backtrack and say okay instead of every second, every tenth of a second or some such thing. So in essence what you would then do is we're not doing frame rate at any frame for maybe we are. But the eye tracker does. I don't know. I had thought the eye tracker does. Yeah. Five hundred Hertz though. But right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The kinds of events that we had before talked about putting into the record for then use in ELAN and NXT isn't based on saying every X seconds something. Give me what's happening every X seconds. One needs to know the duration of these things, right. It's more like, give me the fixations and the blinks. Yeah. So one needs to be able to say Mm-hmm. Durations are in there. But there's a difference between saying that something is in a particular state whatever the frame rate is, ten seconds a minute. That's one kind of way of looking at data, and a parsed version of the data, which isn't at any particular length. Mm-hmm. It relies on this really close frame rate that's underneath. So there's only events. What I'm we're trying to figure out is whether we've thrown time away. No, no. The time the time is still in there. But what you want is to figure out what are the concepts behind that data that you want represented. So rather than saying the eye was at this particular place, here, and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here. Here Okay, so one of the formats in which eye tracker data is analysed is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event, okay. You say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blink from this time to that time. And Okay. So you actually have to show at some time slice rate whether the eye was on the same target as the other guy, a similar target, what we'd both been. So we have to we have all the parts, the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. Now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate. Yeah. But I think that's really unlucky. But but my point is that we mustn't throw away in or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data. Right. So there's two issues here. We're not throwing anything away. Mm-hmm. Mm. But the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data? Would you be so the more you can plan Mm-hmm. So typically the eye will move, right. So over any one second, they eye's actually fixing on a bunch of different things. And you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here what's gonna happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate, it's gonna jiggle all over the place. It's gonna be on this landmark. Yeah. It's on this fixed thing, that fixed thing, okay. You're gonna get lots and lots of stuff. And it's percentage distribution that you're going to want. It's not I went here. It's not like person walking. I went here, I stayed here. It's it's more like a fly hovering. Mm-hmm. So you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation. Mm-hmm. Yeah? Because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events. But the sort of start and end times will give you back to that output. Mm-hmm. As a and then you just measure it against, the the cumulative total time record or something. Against bigger frames. Okay, so the percentage is a cut it's not something you're using for measurement. So Mm-hmm. It's a cut-off for whether or not it counts as a fixation? That's the problem. Is that Mm-hmm. There are two ways of doing it. One is that there's always a cut-off, right. But the other is that there will be a time span, a kind of reaction to some event span. So I'll lag in some of it I suppose there's the saccadic movement itself, for example. Right. Right. And so there are really two ways of looking at this. One would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing, okay. And one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it. Or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't. One one could imagine those two categories. That's that's a kind of testing of our hypotheses. Mm-hmm. But there's a certain amount of dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published. And one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event, right. What percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking. And what percentage of time over some, reasonable time span of a couple of seconds, alright. Mm-hmm. So they'll be they they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places. So we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands. It should still come out that the little sketch I asked this for for last week about NXT and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things. Right. Yeah. That should address all that. Cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after. Mm-hmm. But but because it's also in the based on the the time course of the procedure you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well. Yeah. Okay. Can we draw it to make sure that that this is satisfying Ellen's concerns? So I did have it somewhere. I haven't brought it. Right. There's a white-board, right. Trying to remember it. We love this thing. See if the pens work. So this is A's eyes, right? And B's eyes. And I think what you're saying you should probably draw this right, is that from this time to this time they're looking at triangle one. What you're saying is that you want to know you wanna know after they're looking at triangle one what's happening in this period with this guy, right? Or how alright. Let's imagine a typical construction event, okay. Mm-hmm. There are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use, right. There may be or not a construction already begun, right. Mm-hmm. Somebody makes the first move. There's some kind of communication either gestural, imaginary or verbal, that plans how we're gonna do it, right. Mm-hmm. Before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning. While they're speaking or communicating in some way, the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking, okay. Mm-hmm. They may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest. Let's call it the the construct, existing construct, which could be zero. Mm-hmm. Alright. Or the addendum, the thing which is next going to be added. Mm-hmm. Next piece, okay. Now in neither case, when you draw this, he's looking at triangle one, which you're actually drawing, for the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is gonna be very very short, right. Mm-hmm. Because staring fixedly without interruption, blink or or saccade is is an extremely short event. It it but at that point all of it lumped all the individual fixations as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together as a total sort of gaze gaze time on that. That's fine. So it's in a region it's in a region. Yeah. So Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. That that's a target within the target region. Okay. But even so you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region, right. Uh-huh. So even so you wanna look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place, how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing. Let's call that our measure of alignment. So that's right, A is gonna be on triangle one and various other places. Alright. That's right. And B okay. Yes, somewhere. And we're gonna look at the percentage of of that time where they're both in the same region. Mm-hmm. Right. So what I want to make sure is that we don't simplify, do you know what I mean? So. Temporarily simplify too much, so that. It it as long as we're there shouldn't be anything missing. Cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a DV. Right. And so B has some periods of looking at one and all it will which will also be intermittent. That should be alright. Yeah. Because Right. Yep. So, he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one's gonna overlook lap quite a bit. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So what you want to do is be able to define bigger periods, which is the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall, right? Yes. Mm-hmm. This is sort of some meta level analysis. When they should be. So we. So if we have an event, that the second line then for the second before it. Right. And then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it. Yeah. But that's not something that you can do in the NXT query language, but you can't do that in any this is such special purpose but it's easy enough given the data format for any of these things to do that. I Right. Okay. So you could do it on 'cause it's just a matter of the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you wanna pull out. Because, algorithmically you're already putting together this is essentially already, these fixations with stuff in between. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look, I guess. Mm-hmm. You already have that or no? If it's just based on a stable fixation for so long or something and crossing into that region. It Right. Yeah. So it's all fixations. These are all fixations and saccades, but within the yep. Yep. So that's easy enough. What Yes. So the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here, right? And maybe even having fixations on other things? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yes, because for example for part of that time both B and A are probably looking at the construct, okay. Yep. If if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed, you would tend to look back and forth. Yep. Back and forward. Mm-hmm. Yep. Right. So this isn't. And we should be able to to figure that out. But what you need to do is we we can already build into this GDF format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is. But I think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in some tool and play around with the definitions. Because you won't get it right the first time. Mm-hmm. Sure. So so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And ELAN's a reasonable choice for that, right? So Right. What you need is something no, because you need to be able to see the effects of this. To mm-hmm. Don't know. So I guess this is a case of Craig writing some scripts so Robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying, add this data automatically. It's not that hard, right. It's just you'll have some rules about maybe how long you spend on other objects and whether the other object is the existing construction or not, right. Yeah. So essentially there's AE is divided into TR one and C and other stuff, okay, where C is the construct, the existing thing. And so Ah, right. So if they had a fixation on C you wouldn't be worried. But if they had a fixation on they're yep. No. We'd look at the percentage time I have no idea because I don't know how people look when they're building things together, okay. So there's a there's the addendum and the and the the existing construct. And I don't know whether they're gonna spend more time looking at one or the other. But if they're whatever it is that one is looking at, if the other's looking the same place they're in good shape. But they're gonna look at the clock and they're gonna look at they may look at completely irrelevant Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure, sure. Mm-hmm. And that's what the other stuff that's what the that's what the diagonal stripes are for. That's true. But we can one of the things we'll be doing is categorising people take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock. We'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock a lot more. Yeah. More. Mm-hmm. But that's a separate analysis, right. Sure, it's a separate analysis. So It no no. But you don't wanna throw it away, right. So you can define if all of these things are actually categorised by the eye tracker as to where the eye is, alright, you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say alright for this phase it's TR one, or C. So every separate. Mm-hmm. For this phase it's SQ one or C, okay. Yeah. But what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level, right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then it's a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want. So this is one we hadn't thought of adding before, but we should, right. How would you decide whether something was the current addendum the So that's a human decision. You have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film further on. Yeah. Absolutely. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But we believe But we believe JP to be defining that maybe. Yeah. So so I assume that once you've that sort of information, you got the GDF format. Yeah. You then filter it to say, right, between time X and time Y they're they're constructing that having triangle one to the construct. And then you just say in that time period, what percentage are they looking at triangle one. What percentage are they looking at the construct. Right. Does that sound does that sound reasonable? Right. That's the addendum in the construct should be, kind of they change their true identity. Yep. But their categories of stuff now my kind of assumption was that this was JP land, that's what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence, okay? Right. He's really interested in Mm-hmm. And the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say there were several candidates for the addendum, alright. Which one does Mm-hmm. And and it was the negotiation of which candidate was gonna be the right candidate that's actually the interesting stuff. So I should talk to him about this. He's actually emailed me with a list of things he wants to discuss at length. So I I'll bring this one back to him. This is my question for him. Is he gonna define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out. Or they've been working on construction there for a while. So it may be that they have a coding system that's ready to go and we should just apply it. Yeah. Okay. They do a lot of sub-assembly in the tasks they've been doing. Mm-hmm. So they may well have a. I could believe them, no, taking an interest in that. Let's find out. The general division was language here and other stuff there, right. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. That's what I have understood it to be. So right. But I don't know. What we but we have the now actions actions might mostly be theirs, right. But mm-hmm mm-hmm. I'll just I'll just minute that. But since we have the eye tracker we're gonna have to answer their questions about gaze, right. Eye tracker here. Yes, uh-huh. Right. We know that. I right. So they'll they'll tell us something about that. But presumably what you piously hope happens here is what happened with transactions, right, that the verbal analysis and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points, the same chunking points. But with transaction coding on something like this you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly. It'd be verbal plus action. Because it's a task breakdown. What. It's just a segmentation. It's it is it is a task breakdown. But for the verbal version there are ways of announcing that now we're doing a new one, right. But you you wouldn't do two codings for task level one you wouldn't do transaction coding in a action segmentation. Or that we're finished with the old one. No, you wouldn't. But one of the things you'd like to establish as an outcome of this is that you could analyse either end and you'd get the same chunking of the material. The thing which you guys thought to make in a paper. I don't think that's realistic, because I think what you'd actually do is use the full record of what you have and do a segmentation. I think it'd be hard to understand what was going on if you used just the language without watching the video to decide whether we're breaking down the task. It's a hypothesis. You don't want it to be coding based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things. They are doing these things together. The language events are multi-modal, right. They're doing all these things together. But one of the things that one could imagine doing is having the transcription there and just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates and say when do they stop and start because essentially you're looking at cycling sequences in discourse. Why do you care whether they can do it just based on the the language? It seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data. And if the discourse tells you what's going on that's information. One of the questions is how the information is gonna be shared across these media. And if you can get it all out of the speech, if all of the chunking is available when there is speech, okay, then it's carrying a lot of the burden. It's saying we are done with that and Mm. But I, it's a possibility. But we haven't looked at data like this with this with our old-fashioned analyses. It's mm-hmm. I can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both. And it's it would be really nice to know that that much information, that chunking of the task information is being carried by the language. Because JP's question, the overriding question is what's language for. If people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they're doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant 'cause language is irrelevant, it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not. You could get the entire chunking of the task out of a language. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language that they had both. Because it's a self-contained system as opposed to a system which can't be interpreted without the other system. Uh-huh. I think that one's just bound to fail. Okay. Usually the claim. Almost all studies on language claim that language is a self-contained system which will give you everything you need to know. But. Really? That's the claim. Okay. Alright. Anyway. I didn't say it was true. I said that's the claim. And so it's worth testing. So back back to this main problem, which is the record that we are getting in the first instance is about these they're looking at some region of the screen defined dynamically. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then we need some way of knowing what you can you can see adding these other analyses about, they're jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what percentage of time they're looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the ELAN track or NXT. They're they're both sort of track based in this way. Mm-hmm. But the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that. And I I think in the first instance what we're trying to get into the GDF format is just this. And then we've got no option but to figure out a way to just explore this data, suggest ways about doing it and be able to play them back and see when we think we've got these things right. I don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want, much less how to get 'em yet. Mm-hmm. No no. And establishing the full set will, take us much of the project. So that's right. So Fine. So this is something we're aiming for. But this isn't something that affects what Craig programs for the initial GDF translation. You can we can announce now. My only concern you as I said when I barged in was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later. That's all. So let's just return to this question of frame rate. Because this is the thing we were not planning to transfer into this format. So again, what a frame rate kind kind of coding is it can again be seen as a track. But it says it's a coding like this, right, where you say it's in state A, state B, state C, state A. Every single frame. Okay. But since the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are the ones which get rid of the lower level. Jiggling around in the area of a particular object, right. So if we're moving the green triangle we've defined a region which is dynamically the green triangle, wherever it is. Mm-hmm. We will jiggle around in there. But it doesn't matter where we are in there. That's beneath our level of analysis. Right. Mm-hmm. So you right. So you're happy that it's not gonna have frame rate like this. That interpretation is definable to frame rate by the only way we're gonna use frame rate. But You mean to the tags of the data within it. It's gonna have an interpretation like this. What does that mean? Sorry. Because I can say for how many frames this fixation is officially defined. So that as long as I as long as it's not a untimed event, okay. All the all events have a start time and an end time. And an end time. Right. So. So it's, fine. I can say it's a long one. Or it's a short one. Right. Or it's, twenty milliseconds more than that one. But it seems to me that Ellen's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because this thing in itself is bunch of fixations, right, with saccades. That's Mm-hmm. Yeah. So things like fixation, the number of fixations and with some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well. Fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover, you might want. Because having long steady fixations can be informative. Okay. Mm-hmm. And okay, I'm asking you as an expert. So number of fixations. Percentage of No no. This is this this isn't a leading question. This is a question question. Why would that be informative particularly? If they're holding their if there's less dancing around, the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part. Uh-huh. So there is a difference between even though they're still looking at the same part, if they're looking around it rather than just holding their gaze steady and longer on it. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. On it. So you think that for example if they're looking at one or another apex of a triangle that would make a difference. They were exploring the thing, as opposed to they were simply alright, it there it is. It's it's certainly it's it's worth mm-hmm. Okay, so that really means that we're not throwing away absolute fixations. No, I wouldn't want to throw out Put the actual location Mm-hmm. The screen location of absolute fixations. This is still summary data. He's we're talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one, right. Alright. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. So the spots'll be different anyway. As opposed to out of it. Presumably yes, that probably isn't going to be easy to get out because you'd then have to break up the parts somehow. So you so I thought I understood you to mean exploring the figure. Because your fixation is a point. And the figures are bigger than points. So you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it. Okay. Alright, fine. The So you just want to know the variability of the of the fixation. Yep. Mm-hmm. And wouldn't that differ from person to person? It yes, it can do, but it's also looking at it within their own behaviour to see. Okay. So it's the number of different spots within that region where the eye has fixed the number of different okay. I would say just the number of fixations. It could just be the number of different. So it's a jiggle rate, okay. Cause you're not gonna have the same pixel. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Exactly. Right. So Mm-hmm. So we have the option that we can put in A fixation thing here, right, as well. If you want the smaller if you want the smaller coding in in here. Mm-hmm. To It. So that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object. But you also have the raw fixation data. We can put that in as another track. If you think that that's something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other. All I understood you to ask for was the duration of each fixation inside. That's all he asked for. Yeah. Yeah. If we've got everything, then I suppose you can always yes, it's you're not throwing anything away then. I think and in NXT there's no cost, right, because the you just don't choose to load those. You can come back. Or Right. All we're doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to. So if they're things that you just know are crazy and you're not gonna want then we don't do it. Okay. Mm-hmm. But otherwise we go ahead and dump 'em. Right. Cause it's easy to dump out the fixations. Yeah. So it's the number of different fixations. Okay. So it's the number of fixations did you want you not if it's each, you have to break it down into another tier, right. Actually do you want the average duration? Or do you want the number of different ones? But the duration time as well somehow. Whether it's the average one or Of the fixation. Duration of each fixation in the region. The average should be alright to work with. Yeah. You can say there were three fixations and they averaged a certain time. But you don't wanna what about the overall sum of the durations? The if you've got the number of fixations in the average time, you can then just generate it. Is that which way do you want to then that's the way you want it? You've already got that. That way around? Okay. So that's a measure of jiggle in the region, roughly. Mm-hmm. And did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number. Again, that should be you should be able to derive that presumably from Right. Moving. You can have as many of these as. The extra cost of having these as attributes is not high. So it saves you having to write scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are numbers that are gonna be useful to you. Okay. What's our error of measurement on location on the screen? So to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes, little circles, are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region? It can vary a bit depending on the calibration. But if we're building in a sort of error margin it will be based on pixels around. Right, okay. Right. But there'll also be a minimum one. Cause I'm trying to think that the actual mouse icon is so small, it'll need a slightly larger just because if what you have is a sort of larger error or of error margin around it. Mm-hmm. It's okay, right. Okay. So my question was going to be alright, the mouse is a dynamic object, right. Yeah. The eye track is a dynamic object? Or is it only the the piece that the eye the other person's eye track is on that's that's an object in this definition? No. The the other person's gaze position as well. Is a is an object. Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay. Treated the same as as the mouse say. With plus or minus something or other, around it. Yep. Mm-hmm. Some circular area. Yes, yep. Okay. So you can be on the object but not on the other person's gaze. So there can be a triangle which has A's gaze in the centre and your gaze actually happens to be here. Yes. So if mm-hmm. Yes. You're in the triangle region. Mm-hmm. Does this Okay. But not looking at their individual and fact, they probably will avoid looking directly. Because if they're looking directly at it, it's obscuring the the part. But it's directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap, right, like this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. cause I think that that's gonna that's 'cause the diagram we got there suggesting that they're only looking thing at time. So whether it's triangle or whatever else. Mm-hmm. But so what you're suggesting there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer and maybe an eye at the same time. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. It would say yes, right? Because they would be in the same place. I don't know. So if you you're gonna have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition. Mm-hmm. If the mouse is on the construct, then right, right. The the mouse, the gaze and the part are all layered. Yeah. Yep. But those are different tracks of information. Cause you get 'cause you Yep. So what you want is one track of information about which object it's one, about whether or not it's on the other guy's gaze, and one about whether it's on one of the mouse positions. Right. We treat those as as other objects. But the difference between them and the the parts of the thing to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things so nothing breaks. Okay? But in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information. If we mm-hmm. Because they could look simultaneously at somebody's mouse, somebody's gaze and some object, right. Mm-hmm. Yes, as opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there, right. So. And you want to know those things. So the these are independent. Right, they're independent dynamic objects. So what we want is whether they're looking at the other person's gaze, right, and say they are in this period they're probably not given what I've trying to Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So a definition of we're all looking at and touching the same thing. So imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct, alright. So now that's the construct. And both mouse symbols are on it, right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And both gazes are on it, right. Yep. So at that point you should have a line-up of A is on the construct, A is on the mouse, A is on A is on A's mouse, A is on B's mouse, A is on B's gaze, and B likewise. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So there's a lot of tracks here, right. Right. Because we just added this fixation track. Ooh, I love the eraser. And then there is A's mouse, not their eyes, is on an object, right. Mm-hmm. And the mouse might be on triangle one. But the mouse is also a dynamic object. But it doesn't matter. The mouse we're just saying where is the mouse. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's on this object. Mm. And then A's eye is on A's mouse I guess, right. A's eye might be looking at A's mouse here. A's eye might be looking at B's mouse here, right. These are all the different ways of taking cross-products at the things that could be co-located. Mm-hmm. Right. So you just treat 'em as independent. And I'm guessing from what you say. And then you then you look for combinations of them. Yeah. I guessing from what you're saying you want all these tracks. I think we need to. Because some measure of alignment is looking where the other guy is directing attention. Which is fine. There's no problem with that at all. Mm-hmm. And there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track. One is where the mouse is and the other is where the gaze is. Yeah. So Mm-hmm. So you kinda got the idea here? Yep, yep. Okay. Yeah. So. So it's just a matter of adding the two mouse pointers and the two gazes as extra objects. So. As long as as long as they've got an ID in there we can just say right at this between these times they're looking at that object or they're looking at the mouse, they're looking at whatever. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. But the important thing is you don't treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive. So that actually true. It's just so the objects is a separate level of analysis. Mm-hmm. Cause Right, but that it's also gonna be the case that whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square. If whether they're looking at the objects than whether they're looking at the gaze. Cause they can happen at the same time. Yep. Okay, what do we do about that? Does that happen? Because if you have them close together, there's always some fuzz factor around them. When they get moved together. Right. Mm-hmm. And so if they're left lying close together, okay, or in fact in the not in the model, in the supplies set they're actually neatly packed into a little space. It Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. So what you're saying is a new problem for us, which is I'm gonna change That's the bad one. Mm-hmm. Two objects close together, your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other. Mm-hmm. And they're therefore looking at two objects at once. Yeah. Yeah. So you're saying Okay. Saying they need some new pens. Squeak squeak. Yes. Can you write on my pen pad? New pens. Just say, pens. Pens. White-board pens. White-board pens. So you're saying, they could be looking at square one at this point. I confuse 'em. Cause they close together. Because the two are so close together that their regions overlap. Okay, that's a problem for the data models and either of the things that we were using. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But unless we just define it as they're they are exclusive. That would. And which ever area has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at. What do you mean by greatest overlap? The greatest overlap with what? If you've got your sort of eye position, and it's unlikely to be exactly fifty percent in one object and fifty percent in the other. Ho ho. My spacial reasoning is no good. I put these things on. I think I think you're throwing information away. See I'm the one that uses the white-board. Cause I actually put the the microphones on. Yeah. What I'm thinking is if you've got say one object there and right. So this is thank you. This is the better pen. Part one and part two. And you've got they're sort of they're looking there. Uh-huh. Then that overlap means they're looking at the two pieces simultaneously. Yeah. But just if there's more of it yes, that's that's a decision I'm saying is if they're looking if most of what their overlap is here then we stick with that one. But you had a way of choosing which one, right? Yeah. But it may be a bad idea. It may be a bad idea. You've just thrown data away. Yeah. Yeah. Thing is that with. The gaze will wobble. So you just mean which is it closer to the is the circle what is this circle? They're looking at a pixel or something, right? That's no, that because the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area. It won't just be a pixel. It'll be an actual circle and area. Right. Yeah. The gaze will wobble. So it that's that's going to be it's it's not just a single point. That's natural. Right. So those vary in size. It's it's a it's a sort of lump target. Mm-hmm. And so there'll be a sort some sort of overlap of two objects. Mm-hmm. Or indeed they might be looking from one to another. Or they could just be oscillating mm-hmm. Yeah. Or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you don't want to decide it's only one and throw the other one out. They could be. Yeah. Thing thing is WGDS formats is is working at the moment. It's actually got a separate track for each part. Mm-hmm. Okay, that's fine. So. That I was going to say that's the obvious way to do it. But what pain that's gonna be analytically. Because it's gonna how many parts are there? Each one is yes or no. The the it depends on what you build in. Okay. Couple of dozen. There's different parts there's different parts whether you're doing the tamgram or whether you're doing an airplane or whatever. Right. But but thing is if we if we got if we got tracks for each part we can easily analyse it down later on. Six to a dozen usually. I know ways of getting around this analytically. Mm-hmm. Cause you If they're really close to each other, it's gonna get foxed. Yeah. I think it's very likely that if people are considering mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If they are oscillating though, then that's presumably going to change the weight. So you are actually going to see them flipping between when you decide they're looking there mm-hmm, if they're really close. Not if the regions overlap, okay. If the regions Right. Yeah. Yeah. And if you define the regions so neatly that that, we're losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space, then I actually like the solution, however ugly it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every possible object of gaze. Mm-hmm. Yes. The. It's not the data format I'm worried about. It's the way you do the analysis. Because you don't wanna have to say did they jointly look at triangle one. Okay. Did they jointly look at square one. Okay. Did they jointly look at you need some way of going over the whole thing. Mm-hmm. A thing. Mm-hmm. But we can find ways around that. Okay. I think for now we we do it this way and then we we think about what we need out of it in the end. So Mm-hmm. In ELAN that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalistic way of up-translating to ELAN, there'll be a zillion tracks. Hmm. And it'll probably ruin their viewer. Cause you'll get very sparse data on each track. Uh-huh. It'll be like the old referring expression visualization the map task. Where they talk about one object one landmark and then another landmark. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I always thought that was brilliant. It's big, right. It is big, and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on. But it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on. We'll see if ELAN likes it or not. Okay. But so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream. The. And we better also have even in the NXT up-translation a list of parts. With parts. It it affects the way we do the NXT up-translation and make things easier for people. Right. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. The the the doesn't really list part in the GDF. So. That that that's not a problem. There so that basically what I've got is there there's places where you got the ID though. So you've the an ID for a part, you got an ID for a location on the screen. So it shows you the target, config the clock, whatever else. And then we can easy add IDs for the two mouse points and the two gazes. And from that and basically all the all the tracks are doing is saying between this time there's a look at this object. This ID. So it's effectively a track for each ID. Okay. So what about the point where a part becomes the construct? Do you still identify it as a part? The but what happens there is that the two the the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new ID starts existing at the point where they're joined. I think one should lose that I take it. Cause Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. So you so every time a part is added to the construct, it becomes a new part. So the construct actually has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing, okay. So if there's just the initial thing you've put it in the middle of the screen, that's just the initial object, right. Yep. Soon as you put a part, there's a construct. But it's construct one. Because when you add another part, construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So actually defining all of those as the construct is gonna be the trickiest thing. It's also going to be a problem because you're going to have one part or a construct forming in the middle of a fixation. The And it suddenly becomes and there could be more than one construct at a time, right. Right. So it's not gonna be quite as clear if you can't can't chop it off. Right. So you're looking at triangle one, right, and all of a sudden it ceases to exist. Uh-huh. And then it yes. And it becomes construct or assembly whatever two. Yeah. Oh. There is the construct, right. Cause you can build sub-assemblies. No. And then you can start again. You can build sub-assemblies and then link the part really. Also when you when you screw it up, you start again. Yeah. What why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it? Because the definition Mm-hmm. That that that's what that's what that's the way he's working the moment. Because it's it's generating a new ID when you create a new part. So each Which constituent parts. Yeah. And this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct it's not a construct at all, it's just a one thing. And we don't want triangle one to suddenly have bigger stuff. The problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence. So do we know the difference between we broke it and it went away and it's now part of the construct? But there there's there's joint events. So if a joint event if if there's joint event linked to the item then it's become part of a construct. Of the the. Can we can we tag the constructs with what's in them? There are. The the the constructs are already tagged with that. Yeah. There are. So that I'm there's actually a a separate file of the data format which says for each construct, which which two parts made it made that came together to make that construct. Okay. So we could essentially then we could or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new cumulative list of parts, right. Yeah. But you can still you can still track what parts went into it. But we will Right. So So some fancy programming's gonna have to be done to say I was looking at triangle one and now I'm looking at triangle one in construct one. So you can still find triangle one, whatever. Cause the first construct was triangle one and square one, okay. Yeah. Yeah. But it's easy to do because the each construct has the IDs for the things that construct it. Alright. So now we have to ask So let's imagine this, we've made a construct of two parts, and we're a triangle and a square. And we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle. Mm-hmm. Okay. Are we looking at the square or we looking at the construct? Yeah. Construct. That was the next question I had. Yeah. Yeah. You'll be looking at the construct. Cause that's the way it's defined. This should be looking at the construct. Yeah. There isn't a way to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle. Yeah. Looking at areas within it. The thing is that we still have the X wave traces from the ASCII formats. So if if you want if you want to be able to say I'm looking at a square instead of I'm looking at the construct, that's it is possible to get that data out. Mm-hmm. It's. It is. It's it's not doing it's not doing it in the gest analyzer at the moment. But I can easily add it to give that information if you want. Okay, because that's the example presumably that's the best example of overlapping areas. Cause if if the thing the two the two things are now abutted. Of course there's an area which is common to both of them, okay. Mm-hmm. That'll cover most of 'em. So what I'm trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between something going out of existence 'cause it's joined to construct something going out of existence 'cause we threw it away, right. Suppose we pick up an we we we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we didn't like it, and we took another one. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Is it triangle one? Is it triangle one prime or something like that? It's the replacement for triangle one. Yeah. If you take it if you if you if you create a new part, it gets a new ID. It's triangle two. Mm-hmm. So if you drag a new part out of the parts bin we which way they match. How do I know what it replaces? You don't because that's you'd have to have human coding to do that. There might be multiple triangles that you've broke and you won't know which one they're planning on using it for. The new parts only appear when the previous one's broken. This is true. But if I have triangles one two three, right, and I throw them away, any triangles I take out are to replace one two three. You know which mold they come from. And so you know which shape they match. Okay. But you can't possibly know which one of the ones they're meant to replace. Except that no, you don't know which one they're meant to replace. So you can the Yep. But they're not meant to replace any that haven't been thrown away. Okay. Right. So the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen. Yes. And if there's no more TR one track the TR one track is gone now. They they can appear without them. You with same shape but not the same shape and colour. So there's no two parts with the same shape? There are many. Then same shape and colour. Same identity. Same eye. Yeah. Right okay. Yep. Is that true? You've decided not to make all the triangles red and squares green and okay. That's that's that's what they're at the moment. Okay. So you can tell what it's meant to replace then. Yes. Right. Because it's just a case of the mold, right? One two and three. They Okay. So that's the way it works at the moment. I just assume that's how Nijmegen had set it all up. So So there So shape plus colour. That's back to Tim's day. Yep. You have different colours for the yep. Okay. They're unique. Unique. All the parts are unique. So hang on. That makes the task a little bit easier, right. Yes. The tamgrams are much easier when you can see Mm-hmm. All the lines. Yep. Indeed. It is just a construction task rather than a puzzle. Which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier, doesn't it? Yep. Yeah. But this also Mm-hmm. But but that's hard to code. That's really a thing we might do. Okay. So now let's make sure that the coding would survive that. It's just it's a beautifully controlled situation. The construction task is essentially the same. It's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple. Mm-hmm. For a just to choose a colour at random here. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So. Yeah. So I think that anything's loading. There's there's then two triangle, isn't there? There's two identical triangles in the tamgram. Yes. At the moment there are two small ones and two large triangles. They're actually the same physical size and shape. Mm-hmm. At the moment they're in different colours. That also means in the new parts list they're there for, two large triangles and one small ones, say. Whereas in the revised edition if they were all just black there'd only be one mold in the new parts. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. In when you specify these things, do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on? So is this hard-wired into Tim's program? Or is it just an artifact of the way we Right. As far as I know it's hard-wired. It just appears so. When you specify the molds in the in the file that generates the parts, a list of parts, the molds are just taken out of the file that specifies the parts. Okay. Mm-hmm. So so however many part however many however many parts there are in the file, that's how many parts appear in the in the parts box. The polygon one, polygon two, whatever it might be. So it's hard-wired. So if you have five black triangles, there gonna be five black triangles in the parts box? Or one? If you have five black triangles gonna be five five parts in the five black black triangles in the parts box. Uh-huh. So minor modification needed for Mm-hmm. But what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re-use a triangle. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm mm-hmm. So if you so if you only want one black triangle, you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then re-use that that triangle five times in the configuration. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. As long as it this is possible. So that that just is a kind of thing which is so simple, so much like a single one zero variable change that it if it that doesn't already exist. Yep. Hmm. Yep, same pieces. But what Has multiples. Cause I'm I'm trying to kinda map this onto Baufix. And Baufix has the the The the nuts are red and all the flat things are wood colour something. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. No, so they can have different nuts there. Nuts that are different colours. The same part the same part is different colours. But same part in different colours. But they don't have enough to make unique Mm-hmm. No, what I mean there's more than they're multiple pieces that look the same. Mm-hmm. So what. So when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then there'll be lots of them lying around. And I think that's how the robot is set up to there are five five green bolts. Mm-hmm. So I think we've gotten to the point where, to try to summarise, we think Tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want. Mm-hmm. Here is one. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. But I'm still worried about what the effects are for analysis. Okay, so all I'm doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that we'll miss by a simple view of for example regions and looking at triangle one. Because you were aiming at something in the GDF format and I wasn't quite sure what. And. When is triangle one not triangle one anymore. So okay. Does it keep its identity. So I'll summarise what we said about that part that every time you cast off a new part from a mold or, every black triangle has a different ID. Mm. Identity, yes. And it's a black triangle 'cause which mold it came from. But you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen, because you can't mind-read. Yep. Mm-hmm. That's true. So how can we define the shapes that people build? What do you mean define? Assuming I was for a moment I was JP and I wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing. Okay. And I wanted to look at the strategy. And I wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever. Suppose I can't talk to you and I'm doing this task with you and I can't talk to you. Mm-hmm. The thing which is gonna be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you. I can reach for the next thing and you can go where I reach. But if I have sub-goal, some long-term sub-goal, of doing something clever with putting these together 'cause it's hard and then putting these together 'cause it's hard, there it's gonna be almost impossible to convey that to you. And the difference in the history of construction, right, is an important thing, and I wonder how we can get that information back. Mm. I think that this is a human coding that is part of the action coding. Do you think? Because I don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time. No, it why is not that's that's not the question I'm asking. The question I'm asking is what's the history of the construct? So you have the the names of the things in there. And you have two constructs suppose we have two sub-constructs. And whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier numbered of those constructs, right. Yep. How do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct? When the when the final construct the way the the way the constructs are defined in the file, you've got your parent construct and the parts that it's constructed out of. Mm. Okay. And as I say, the. It's it's it's parent child relationship. So you got parent child relationship and the child can be a part or it can be another construct. Okay. So could construct one is a red triangle and a green square. Construct two is two green squares, okay. Construct three, right, is a red triangle, a green square and another red triangle. Construct four okay. But that's okay 'cause they all have different underlying part numbers. And when you say what a construct No. Okay. And you can so how are we gonna tell when for example you think we're gonna have to do human coding on when two sub-constructs are put together. No, that's a definition wherein a construct has constructs as children? No, no. Yes. Yes. Cause there's a joint action. Okay. The result what you need for a join action you need to a construct and a part, two parts, whatever you're taking together. Mm-hmm. Okay. And then the result of that is a construct. You've got time when that happens. You can see that construct appeared at that time. Right. And you can still track the children of that construct. So we could zip through this and look at all the interactions in which people build sub-construct contstructs first which we expect them to do as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't, okay. Mm-hmm. And we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children. Yep. Yeah. So we can easily look at things like that automatically. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's just the why they why they get new parts that's the problem for us. We can't if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we don't know we can't know why until they do something with it, if they do. Mm-hmm. We haven't actually made a rule that you can't collect extra parts, right? And the extra parts don't appear. So you can't collect them. You said that. Yeah. But you can break you you can but you can break one when you break one, you don't cast off the mold yourself, it happens automatically? There are a couple of them that it's greyed out. They really very faint. So see the mold is there. But they don't come filled until Yes. No no. You have to break one to get one, okay. Yes. Okay, never mind then. It appears suddenly the new part lights up sort of thing and it's there. So they just have to use it. Uh-huh. But they have to drag it up past the mold line. Yes. Yeah. They have to bring it into play. Mm-hmm. And you can't just bring extras in case you screw up. No. You have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra. Nope. That. That is one think unlike say the Baufix or anything. Mm-hmm. I assume the the Baufix. Where there's extra parts. Mm-hmm. The there aren't any extra parts. Mm. Mm-hmm. And at the moment the software doesn't allow for that. But it does have replacement. Yes. Yeah. Replacement, but no superfluous so you can't have a a standard stock with extra parts that it'll never use. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. There there's a so you so so you appreciate you appreciate the cost of screwing up. So this why question doesn't even arise because 'Cause you know what they're gonna do with it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. When they decide to move it past the mold line, they're doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because They do it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. By the by the time by the time they're doing that they must have already broken something. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, that's right. So you'll so you'll know what they're replacing. Yeah. Yeah. So they do. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. So they rejected something or they broke something inadvertantly. Okay. Is there a way of telling the difference between intentional and unintentional breakages? How would you do that? Intentional in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts. Yeah. But it's like the trash can idea that they bring a You have to hope that there's language and one of them says something. No, they both put they both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it. But there'd be no way of coding that automatically, right. How could you possibly do that? Mm-hmm. But that's a human coding, right. You mm-hmm. Yep. So that just has to be coded. There's there's no way you could tell that just from the raw movements or something. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Not generically. So that's gonna particularly be a problem for JP, right. Mm yep. Because if they're gonna do it by gesture they'll build up a convention, right. What else do we need to know? Remember all the things we're looking at are with language with and without language. And it's gonna be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language. Which means it's probably not okay. Unless they develop a convention. Suppose they start off with language and then they say hey look, let's do it like this. But this is properly part of the action coding. Yeah. It Although What I'm trying to remember is if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together. Sure. So we should make a wish list, right, as a side effect. Absolutely. I just wanna make sure that a wish list, yes. Yes. They they don't both break. They both Mm-hmm. If if if what if one if one person's trying to get a part to a part that isn't that that so the part that's just sitting on the screen that's not being touched. They both break. So the intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks. For sure that's or is not necessarily intentional. No, they could just make a mistake or screw up. Yeah. They could just screw up. Yep. Yeah. Mm. They could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Or I don't think that's very good, no, we'll get a bad score. But that's bringing in the the language thing again. Mm-hmm. Let's just throw that away and start again. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Which reminds we have fixed the score problem. Have we? Cause. Cause it was through the rotational part. Yes. At the the percentage score. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So our yes, rather than the number of penalties or or something. No, the score is fine. Was the percentage overlap and that made the score? Yeah? That's the way it's worked out. That's when I left. But the problem was to do with the they had a relative and absolute piece and it's all to the symmetry of that. Do you know which which which one was the top right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But that's all been fixed. So as long as it's defined, fine. That's that's that's back. Yes. Yep. It wasn't it wasn't a bug. It it was a. Don't tell me it was a feature. No, no. Yes, it was something that had to be defined and the Dutch lot didn't. It was them just forgetting to define an attribute they had to which is probably a documentation fault, right. Alright. Yeah. Okay. So that was it was actually their their fault. I've I've. Oh. So. But it's not clear enough in the documentation. It's it's in the documentation. Yeah. Yeah. But it's two thirds of the way down quite a long page. But it is quite fundamental and causes quite immediate problems if you don't know about it. But The right. Yeah. So Yep. Not prominently flagged. Yep, exactly. Okay. Yeah. A communication flaw. But. Okay. So we can now that's now just lovely. And there won't be any crazy scores anymore. Yeah. Is there a. While we're on past things, is there anything else you wanna tell us about the prior part of this, which is what else is holding you up from Uh-huh. Or we're. We should should go back to the beginning. The Camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because in the old version it seemed to interfere with it. Oh. I have to use a new page. But when Craig re-compiled it and did his new version it seems to work fine. Right. Yeah. So it doesn't slow down the eye tracker. Nothing we can tell. It doesn't do anything nasty. We so we pay for it and Nothing important and nothing big enough they're gonna look at it, right? No. No the the there's very small graphical bugs. No Mm-hmm. But it's it's not it's not big thing. It's like couple of white pixels in the course of a task. So it's there's distracting. No. No. Alright. So the. The problem was that there are two Camtasia records. Yes. There will now have to be two Camtasia records because each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback. They don't see their own gaze. They don't see their own gaze to the other person. They see the other guy's gaze, right. Yep. Yeah. So there'll need to be two separate Camtasia videos generated. I know. Do you need two copies of Camtasia to do that? Hopefully we won't. You mean officially? Or I was assuming we'd just get one and one licence both of us. But then the the question is there a licence for Camtasia where you just need one editing thing and two recording things. Cause the recording the recording program is just quite a it's quite a small program. It just generates the video and so don't don't know if it's worth having a look at the licensing for that just to see. Okay. Check out Okay. So you're gonna look into this, right? Suppose technically we should have two because it'll be two machines. Look at the licence conditions, I never pre-judge licences until I've read 'em. I suspect that it will. It'll be per machine I would think. Hmm. I'll have a I'll have a look at the actual Camtasia licence. So we Mm-hmm. The other thing we It 'cause it's now twice twice the size of a mm. So and hold on, before we go any further. So this has implications for data storage, right? Because it means no, this is three times, right, 'cause no, we're gonna build we're gonna use JavaScript to build the videos on the fly, right, 'cause it's fast. So the the permanent storage is just the Camtasia stuff. Yeah. So is that a problem? Where are we putting things? Is there mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Is there such a thing as dual track video? Because you can certainly mix things. Ideally one doesn't really want to have these things. Because we're using them for back-up and for coding. We don't really want to play them independently. We can put 'em in the same thing, right? We do almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel. Time aligned. Mm-hmm. You can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution. But that's maybe a problem, right, because So the synchronization's gonna be a problem. The other problem is Camtasia has to be manually launched on both machines separately. Yeah. What are we doing for synchronization otherwise? During the task there is a flash and a bleep. Not during the task. Before. For each task. Before the task. Yes. Okay. So that we'd have to re-align them. We couldn't dump them from their start points. Yes. Maybe you could. The thing that you're dumping them onto just starts running with the flash and the bleep. You turn on the two copies whenever at different times. But they're still no? Is the what what what are they I don't really understand the the parts that are operating here. Camtasia. Two videos are turning on. There is no time stamp that comes from some common source. But No, they're on the two separate machines and you you start and end them separately. No. Mm-hmm. The they they're not talking to each other. They're just recording. You start it recording and it starts recording what's on one screen. Right. And you start the other recording on the other machine. Right. So These are these are back-ups. And they're they're totally separate. Okay. They don't know about the other one. Right. So the flash get allows you to hand-synchronize them later if you need to by stripping extra video off the front. Right, is there a mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. As long as you make sure you start 'em before the flash then you're fine. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep. But it will there's a a cost of having to go to back-up, which is synchronizing them. Mm-hmm. So they'll include things like the eye tracker calibration, right, which is not a bad thing actually. Yes. Because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject. See how how long it took them actually. That's that's true. How long did it take them to calibrate. Right. Yeah. Or. And hand every time we re-calibrated the damn thing slipped. How many times before the validation worked or something. That's true. Okay. That actually helps. So you so you should start the Camtasia really early then. At the moment that's what I was assuming on on doing that it's done first. I mean that Right. Yep. Mm-hmm. Right. Okay. Right. No, that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't. Mm-hmm. Because. You go back and actually yes, they were crap. Isn't that the answer? That's a technical term. That's a a technical categorization in psychological research. Yeah. Yes. The other thing we were getting sorted out was the the microphones. Cause only one of the Camtasia videos will actually have the soundtrack. And that's because? We've got one cable and to the two mics. I suppose we can do it is it would it be worth splitting it? We need real sound recording, right. That's that's two track. That's stereo. So at at the moment what we've finally just at twelve o'clock today looks like we've got it sussed is to get one channel one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo single file. Alright. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Unfortunately the on one machine. On on what? Sorry. It's On Camtasia. The display PCs. The Camtasia video. Or multi-media thing. That's not where you're putting it. Mm. Okay, you've got the proper sound record. That's our only sound record? Yeah. Yes. But you're not dumping it through Camtasia to record it, right. It's Yep. You're before we were gonna use Camtasia at all, what we were gonna do what were we going to do with the sound? It's Camtasia that's recording it. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yeah. So is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through Camtasia rather than running it out straight? How good is it? Yeah. Have to really question. No, you got you you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anything else on the Windows. Mm-hmm. So you can you decide whatever quality you want. So got a bit of. Okay. So what you're planning on doing it is bunging it on one of the Camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the Camtasia track. It's an easy bit of. And then you're gonna bung it on the other Camtasia track too if you need it, right? And then then they can do sound analysis on that. But we'll just we're gonna store all three separately then. And the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the Camtasia videos. But you'll know when the real experiment you'll know the relationship between that and the eye tracker timings? Because the the synchronization, the audio and the audio visual synchronisation comes at a specific point in the eye track file. Yeah. No human intervention required. It's time-stamped. No, it's it's stamped into it. So it's just after it prints the line starting experiment. I'm pretty sure it's just. Yeah. Yep. But hold on. Do we need that? I I thought the way that Tim had this set up originally, the time stamps used there would be joint time stamps between the audio and the eye tracker, so that, the audio record ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we didn't have to do any extra hand work, any chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay. So we're relying on your MATLAB script to get us the chopped version of the audio, right? The the MATLAB script just says gives you the times of the audio beep in the signal. Right, so we can either adjust the eye track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever, however many seconds. So I just. Okay. Right. So we there's gonna be a way to, sooner or later, to align the eye track, Camtasia one, Camtasia two with two sound channels. Yeah. But the lining up the Camtasia two is gonna take he's working on a MATLAB script for the sound but not for so the one that's got the sound on it, that'll also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up. Right. Mm-hmm. The one that doesn't have the sound on it, it won't. Ah, the bleep we'll find. Oh. So it's just got the bleeps. Okay, so no hand synchronization required at all. As long as the scripts work, right. Yeah. Kay. How confident are you about the finding these things? Pretty confident. But you you've you've seen them. Mm. It was it was. So we just have to hope we don't have any subjects with the odd vocalizations. Right. Right. I don't see him with ten kilohertz. Right. They also tend to have a funny shape, beeps. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Cause this this is the drop-out test. Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay. Is there an end signal? When you decide it's all over, does it ping you back and Right. The the there's a signal at the start and the end of every trial. Okay. So Yep. So when you've? Yep. Okay. It's just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you're running things, and so saving a percentage of a trial being able to do that is sometimes a good idea. Mm. Okay. Yes, it's a stereo jack. It's a stereo jack. I know but so you you got a solution for that then? But it's a mono microphone. Mono mono recording on microphones. Line in. Going through a line in. Right, okay. So it's a so it's a so it's quieter because it's not as though it's not powered. Yeah. But it's still, think. We we still pick up a signal. Can we do can we do something better than that? You're sure there's not a better solution that involves 'Cause, people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something. Like having. You never know if the data is there then. It's crazy. We're in an anechoic room which we specially, built an anechoic. But, sound room which we specially built for this. Yeah. And you're gonna want forced alignment. We're in good circumstances. We shouldn't screw it up more than we have to. Is there anything we can do to improve this? Yeah. No. Yeah. No no. No. No, no. Better to collect and sort. Do you have a powered microphone or something. The when they are the they have batteries in them. It's the mono Wait wait, I thought that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket. But there's not doesn't. But doesn't seem to be powered because the because the line input's so low. Right. Sound card? So you said the problem was the the is expecting a mono microphone input. The sound the sound the the the the the the jack that it's plugged into is stereo. That the line is stereo, the input is mono. Right? Is that what you said? Right. Is ah. But when you plug in when it's recording from microphone, it records in mono. So is that fixable? Is there any way. That's somewhere in the sound card. And. A new sound card is fixable. I think a new sound card sounds a better solution than monkeying with trying to filter white noise out. Yeah. We have a I suppose it one thing you do is record the speech signal separately for each person. But then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together. Which isn't hard. Yep. But it's only got one input, right. So if each machine the recorded the the the user on that one. Its own track, its own video. You have to align the videos anyway, right? Yeah. I'm not the technical person who would do it. I believe it's easy to put two monos into a stereo signal. Yeah. They. So the. So it's easy. Yeah. Easy. So. If nothing if nothing else if nothing else you can do it in a MATLAB script. But I know who to ask. You just write read read file one, read file two. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then you just. So is there any reason why we don't do that? But then the the MATLAB the MATLAB script will tell you how far apart they are. But it's the same as Mm-hmm. Cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them. Cause you got a you got a list of where the where the beeps are. And then you say right, this stream is don't nought point two five seconds behind the other one. Says Robin thinking about cutting and splicing. Yeah. Okay. In the old days want a little if they'd been in the same room we would have had a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well just to make sure. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Cause it's slightly dicier if his scripts don't work then you don't get the overlap. I wanna see several of them. I wanna see one of them look really nice before we start running subjects. Can we do that? It doesn't have to be a real trial. Yeah. It just has to be two guys talking in the two bits. Yes, that's right. And then We've both been so badly bitten in the past. I just wanna know it works the way you expect it to work. This is not a a gesture of mistrust. This is just experience that if anything can screw up it will. Yeah. I I'm trying to choose my language carefully because we're being recorded. But you'll hear more choice language at the point when we've all done a lot of work and and then we discover we can't use the session because of some thing we didn't think about. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But this this sounds reasonable to me. So then They've both got the same sound card. Mm-hmm. So I think. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. And then we combine. Do do they both have the same sound card problem? I wouldn't count on it. Okay. So. Yeah. Yeah. Cause 'cause Yes. It's probably worth mentioning this to the guys in the garage in Toronto, right. To say mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So the the external version's got plugs that size and that that is stereo microphones. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Right. But. The other. So the colour the colour can do it. It's just that the connectors on the the connectors at the back of the computer can't. I think tell the guys. I think that's a if the documentation said it could record in stereo then I think we should talk to them about how they've done this. Is you're not sure from the documentation what it says it can do? To. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But as far far as we can and find the web site of the, the the Creative Labs web site and the review of it. And they weren't entirely clear. But they both suggested that it is there is a mono that there there is a mono microphone. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's just the way they wired it. So it's getting late and I've got a two o'clock and I've got a nice lunch. Right. Okay. So I wanna eat my lunch today. What did you wanna get through today more? Okay. I think it was useful going through your expectations about this. Mm-hmm. Cause that's quite a bit clearer in my head at least but I think mostly we leave you to go away and re-design the GDF or add new bits to the GDF along these lines. I'm. And basically out the output the GDF is just gonna be a whole series of events, with start and end time. And then. Yeah. Right. And the event's gonna have whatever the object is that's being looked at and things. Right. Okay. And then, it's a matter of we're gonna put whatever filters you need after that. So right, I just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly, find out how percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever. Right. Right. Right. Okay, so given that there are these events recorded, we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point, for example, right. There are also motions being recorded of objects. Yep. So. Right. So you got. There there's move events. There's look events. There's fixations and blinks now at the moment as well. Mm-hmm. Right. And, and see looks at objects and looks whatever else. Mm-hmm. So Yep. Okay. But I think the thing to do is for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you, and try to change the spec so it reflects this and maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something and the right thing to do is for us to look at the spec the way you understand it now and some data. Yep. And then Ellen'll have new ideas about what's needed or about these post-analyses, and then and we can add 'em in. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I will. So I'm right. But it's gonna emerge over time. That's clear. That that's great. I'd before we break up for lunch I just wanna make sure that I know how long it's gonna be before we're in run mode, okay. So the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way, we need to be recording sound online. So the spec to the other conversation. Okay. So that's a thing that has to be solved. The shape thing is solved. That's solved now. Mm-hmm. We think. Test. We believe. We have to test. Right. So that's that that that should be done this week. Yep. In fact tomorrow for example. All the shape problems are solved. Generating shapes, no problem. Scoring shape overlap, no problem. Nothing is problem there. There are no visual display problems. You don't have your models, or do you? Mm-hmm. They had their inspection last week. JP staggered away from it and Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Anything you actually need fixed. Mm-hmm. You know. Yep. Okay. I haven't had any discussions with him since. Joe doesn't live here anymore, right? But he wasn't gonna be booking any time to us after the thirty first of October. So that means that any bugs that need fixed are now Craig's responsibility, right? You don't have any change on that, right? Okay. Fair enough. Cause he that's what he said to us originally. So I would assume, no more contact with Joe. It's not fair to get work out of somebody for free. So ask Craig instead. Okay. He's physically here. Yeah. If we want to pay him for some more time we can do that. Would that be a just better use of our time in. I don't think he wasn't paid in advance. He's being paid in arrears. So it doesn't matter. Right. I think it's better to have all the software. But he he is around and believe. And if if the if if it's a Right. It's just maintenance at this program at this point and. But if everybody has a lot to do and, Joe could give it a couple of hours, which is what it might take just to fix it, then let's do it because starting run-time is now getting to be fairly urgent. If he can give it, because the problem is you gotta have immediately when you discover a bug in that. Mm-hmm. And we can make Craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. But we can't make Joe do this alright, so there's some trade-off between availability and speed from start to finish, given that this is somebody else's code. Yeah. So it's a kinder way. It. Yeah. So. But it sounds like you don't think there's anything that actually needs fixed at the moment. Yeah. Because we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something and you got work rats. Right, so we're we're we're building models. And how many models do you need to completion? Right. We We have the design somewhere. And how long does that take? And you got And about complexity? Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. You're waiting on Marloes. Okay. You can cold call her today, this afternoon. Yeah. I think so. Cause I have to check back with JP fairly soon. Okay, he wanted to The next eighteen month plan, great. Deliverables, great. Progress with the experiment, that's what we're doing now. Okay. What do we think, if you have a fairly hectic week, are we looking for subjects next week? Okay. Ads go up. I do. I do. But I think ad should probably go up this week. We want people for for next week. Mm-hmm. Is that okay? Is anybody now terrified at the thought that we're live next week? There are people coming in here one after another. Or two two after two, more likely. Yeah. That's her job. Yeah. Okay, is this is this generalised is this generalised anxiety, Robin? Come on. Or do you have a specific thing that okay. Yeah. Aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live. So we we wanna do some piloting at the end of the week? Yep. Right. Yeah. So we'll get we'll get the audio stuff tested, single microphones. Get that tested next couple days and I I assume that's not something you need me for in terms of that. Okay. Right. Right. She's using but she's actually relaxed that somewhat. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ostensibly booked time, which isn't Okay. So you can dash in there for half an hour at a time? Doesn't sound very useful for you. Uh-huh. Okay. We've but we have we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway. You guys sort it out. Right? And except by permission of us, alright. We own it. Mm-hmm. So we can change that. Everybody acknowledged the other week that we had priority. Right, but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you're bumped. Yeah. Don't worry. There's a booking system, right. So it's public what's booked and what isn't. Mm-hmm. I thought that was the problem that your mornings weren't sliced off on the booking system. Okay. No. Alright, maybe should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see. Alright. Uh-huh. Cause if you're told use the booking system. Just a we think we spoke to all the people who used those facilities the other day. But we could be wrong. So. Right. And what are the people upstairs downstairs have as rules about who you hand the keys to. The two key holders are here. Cause, we like people to know to ground thought the lending for the booking system Caroline. I see. From Caroline? Or the general office? The general office. See, 'cause you're supposed to have training in okay, so that's the safety. I see. But no, they need an account on this machine actually to use it. They need account on these machines so that they could book. They couldn't actually log in. And you control those accounts. Mm-hmm. Okay, that's fair enough. Okay. Okay. We're also working on a way of making sure that the that the machines return to zero state when they're when you come off them. Uh-huh. That's safer. Because it's the people have been leaving people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around on them, right, which we think is what's critical. Cause then they learn the first time. Okay. I really have to get out of here. Okay. So what else is important before you run? Piloting piloting. Nothing, right? You have we have to build the things. You got willing heads. We have to try the things. We have to check them with Marloes and JP that they like the representation, the variables, right. How about you have any time on Friday? I don't think I brought my diary up. But maybe. I get a email back. Why? Maybe you and I should be the pilot subjects. First pilot subjects, the ones who know which questions we wanna ask. And then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing. Okay. So. Okay. Mm-hmm. This is generalised floating anxiety. No no. It's it's it's wisdom. But. Because actually if we make comments, they feed back into the development. Hmm. So do you know what time of day you might want? Cause I should I should check that. Okay. You don't you don't need me involved in the pilot, do you. Unless it's a bug report. You all have to you'll have to be there to when it falls over. I'll I'll I'll I'll be around. But I'll make sure. But hopefully it will run smoothly and I can relax. Yeah. Okay. So that all sounds good fun. I can just leave you guys here. Why not.",
