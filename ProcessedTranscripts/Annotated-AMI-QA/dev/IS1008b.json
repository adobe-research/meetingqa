    "displayText": "Okay Agnes, you can help me for the slide when okay. Yep. Sure. Okay, welcome back. I hope you have a fresh head and a fresh time. Now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting. Okay, and we'll issue some information from all of you. And it's in the, sharing folder. And I will invite the Christine and the Ed and Agnes to discuss on the various subjects. So can you go to the next slide? The agenda of the meeting is opening. Then I'm going to talk about the project management, what I'm going to do, and of course, I'm doing the project management and secretary both, okay, to take the minutes of the meeting. And there are three presentations. One is new project requirements. And the second one about decision on remote control functions. And finally we are closing. And the meeting time will be forty minutes, so you have to be very quick. And the management come with the new proposal, okay, and I have to discuss a few points on this. Both says new insights in the aim of your project. The one is the teletext becomes outmoded, okay because of the computer systems and the new technology. So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. And the second one is about the remote control. Should be used only for the TV. That's what our management says. And the third point, it's very very important to establish our marketing or corporate image, okay, with this new project or new product. Okay. So I will invite Agnes, can you go to the third slide? No, this is the third slide. Okay. So, I'll invite Christine to discuss about the functional design. Kay, do you wanna open the I'm number two. Sure. Um. You're participant Two? That's it. Do you want the mouse, or do you want me to Mm-hmm. I'll do the notes. Thanks. So I figured we should identify some user requirements, and from my experience, I wanna and from research the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button, you can't have waffling on this point. Really have It needs to be able have to be able to find it. Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. So I also, since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and go beyond those, as I said in the first meeting, and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in the construction, especially in the the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance, and it is reliable, and so forth. I did a little history on the remote controls and when they were invented and so forth, I guess this guy Zenith created the Flashmatic, which I kinda like the idea, 'cause maybe the remote control made a big flash when you turn the TV on and off, that might be interesting. So it was highly directional flash light that you could turn the picture on and off, and the sound on and off, and change channels I think those are still requirements we have today, fifty years later. And it was really a pioneering innovation, but it was sensitive to the sun, so that it would start off by the it would easily cause problems. So, in addition to looking at the functional so all these devices are examples of where mm they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is really something to keep in mind. Fantastic. It'd be easy to find. And you'd you could throw it at things if the TV didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. And since I'm not really Industrial Designer, I didn't really know what to do with this slide. But I just took some different schematics and I put them into this, I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. I don't know why we were asked to do this. So, personal preferences, I'm really thinking outside the box here, and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an a a size a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it. I think you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, and kind of blend in with things, so you didn't have to have a problem with the decoration of the user's home. I think it needs to be waterproof, because sometimes they fall into cups and, it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that. One of my requirements needs to tell you when it's done its job or not, because half the time, I keep pushing on the remote control, and I don't know if it's actually understood my message, I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue. And course I never wanna replace the battery. So, that's those are my preferences, and that's my presentation. Let me interrupt you if you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. Yes. Okay, because especially today, you have the family and the kids, okay, and the kids throw it and they play with their remotes and. Run over it with a car. Yes. Okay, so if you can add the feature, okay, for your fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, okay, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, if I'm not wrong. Good idea. Good idea, I'll Yes, very good. Maybe you can add it in that. Okay, thank you Christine, and any questions or clarifications, or any discussion on the functional design? Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? Cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, whereas having something like, dunno, steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. Hmm. Titanium. Titanium would be be heavy, too, wouldn't it? Titanium. Yeah. No, I wanted feedback, I think we need to rank these, but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts. Yeah. Sure. No, I just wondering that you had any sort of. I like titanium. It's light. Expensive. But who said who said we were, nobody told me what our financial objective is, so It'd be hard to inflate something made out of titanium though. The marketing comes out. Yes. So the I'm sorry because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing. Let me go quickly, maybe if I can go back. I know the project plan and the budget. So I can close this, not sure. Was in This. So let me see where is this file. That's Christine's. This is Christine. And that's mine, I think. That's yours, okay. Saving. In modified. I don't know, I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell. Okay, I will send you a mail, okay? The project may be the project aim, okay. At the end of the day, the company wants to make at least the fifty million Euro. Okay, and of course the price will be very reasonable on the sales side. Okay, that maybe Eddie will talk to you about the price and how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market. Okay. Then you can come back with your feedback. And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion. This remote control, okay, it can be for universal, to use for any TV. Okay, and it will be slim, okay, and Not fat. Not fat? Not fat. Okay. Might be hard to find, though. Yep. Hmm. But let's try it, okay, with the designs, okay, the functional designs. Okay. Okay? So any other questions? From her side, I don't think there's too many more questions. Okay. If you can come Okay, from the marketing from the marketing side, just to give an idea what the management is looking for, a remote control to have a I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro, with a production price of twelve and a half Euro. Thank you Christine for time being, so then Ed, so can you tell about Mm-hmm. Scuse me for one sec. I think from what we're trying to find, we're looking for, I don't think that price is exactly in the market. Okay? I'll explain myself here now in the sense that in the recent surveys, from the ages from fifteen to thirty-five, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. Twenty-five Euros, that's a reasonable price. That's a market price right now. Now if we're gonna take a risk, and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, but give them added things that they don't have now, then it could possibly sell. Yep. Yep. Obviously the risk is there. Too expensive, they're not gonna buy. But, I think there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested. And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. Speech recognition?. Mm-hmm. Obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. I dunno, louder, softer, on, off. That might be a possibility, even though it costs more, to be the first on the market to produce this. Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. So we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly. Fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. So maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep and they can find it through, ten tons of newspapers, magazines, whatever you have at home. But, in the cost that the management is looking for, that's not gonna be possible. But if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some colour to it, if it's easy to use, if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, off, remote, it goes beep beep, I can find my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the TV on. So we're gonna have to look at it in this global idea, with the ideas of the industrial design. But, price obviously we have to talk about. Yep. What do you think about the design? Do you think you can make it or What do you think about the design, what he was talking about of the speech recognition? I'm sorry? Speech recognition. Training is always an issue with commands. Mm-hmm. So we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process, it could reduce the overall cost. Not sure how. But anyway, I think also that this might impact the battery life. So, maybe what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly so that send power to it. Or maybe set it out in the sun and it gets from a solar cell inside there so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things. Hmm. It seems also like with the speech recognition, it's a great feature, but if you're watching TV, there's a lot of ambient sound, and it's words. It's not just, noises like something hitting. It's actual speech, so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the TV speech, and the the user's speech. Otherwise, you can say remote. Off. But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing, all of a sudden, you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies, because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your TV. So, I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems, then it'd be a really good marketing gimmick. Mm. But, I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation. Very good point. Because with speech recognition I'm not that good at that idea but if it's a one-word recognition, 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States, a friend of mine says call Mom, and it calls up Mom. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Kay the radio can be on and everything. Yep. Because I think with speech recognition, if the remote or the telephone it has exact word that it has to hear. Mm-hmm. I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television. If somebody's speaking on the television, they're not gonna stop and say remote, okay. Mm-hmm. So I think that something could be designed to recognise single word Like the telephone. Yeah. No, I think it's a great idea if we can design it to suit those requirements. No because this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home, and the telephone called immediately so that's kinda cute. Yeah. What I can suggest to you, Christine, okay, if you need the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like Intel or IBM, okay, because they're already in this speech recognition part, okay. And you can maybe have some technical backup from them, some kind of a technical tie-up. Okay, and if you want, I can coordinate, okay, to get some information, okay, and you can let me know, okay, so what kind of the details you require okay, to add this feature in this project. I don't think it's the difficult. And we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from today. Okay, we'll find that out. Yep. From your side you're gonna have to go back the management and be more precise. Yes. What do they want? Yes. Take a risk on the market? Something that's gonna cost more, but could very easily make a boom in the market? Yes. Yep. Because it has to be something totally different, has to be totally new. Something that nobody has right now. But end of the day, you're the sales guy, so I will come back and sit on your head because you are going to give your sales projection, okay. And it's gonna cost. Of course it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit, okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. So I don't mind to convince, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project, okay, if you can make out of the money from this project. Obviously. If the bottom line is positive. Yes, okay I don't mind to convince the management, okay. Mm. The management says, okay, so they don't want certain facilities, which it's already worked, okay, they want something new, okay. Speech definitely they will agree, I don't think they'll say no for that, okay. And I hope I can convince the management on that, okay. So if you have any new ideas, okay, for you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any special, okay, coordination, okay, between any technical companies, which you can hide their technology backup, okay, for your functional design or technical design, okay, then I am ready to do that. And what's your comments about so you are finish, Ed, so Okay, I'll hand over to Agnes. Maybe if I go through my presentation, you can sort of see what the user perspective is, and how it ties into the other two comments. Mm. Yes. Mm. Just gonna close this. Where are you, here? Mm participant three. Participant three. Nope, here Good. Okay, so I'll yep. Okay. Thanks. Is it okay? Click mm. And that's fine. Okay. So, basically, the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. So, in our case, existing remote controls. And then, what the good ideas are, and what the bad ideas are, and why they're bad and good, which isn't always as obvious. We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that's not the case. Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work. And then what the remote control should look like, obviously, once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are. So, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the TV on and off. You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the TV to regulate contrast or whatever. So, the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls, in general. The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. Often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. And that the buttons are too small. So, here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side, you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. The buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny. They're hard to see, and okay, they're labelled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. Whereas, on the other side, you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. So, I would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons. So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit, or to a minimum, sorry, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed, like the on button being really obvious the channel changing and the volume, and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. Which, I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably. So, that's pretty much it, I don't know if you guys have any questions or Yep. It's seems very understandable. Clearly your research and ours heading in the same direction, the only thing that I saw missing from your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it. Yes, that's true. But that's okay. Yeah. That's why we're all here at the table, so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and it's complementary. Yeah. I also think that the feel of it when you hold it, is something that was expressed more in in in my design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about, the look and the feel, and you're First. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely a very important factor, especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases, I think. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I don't have any questions. Sounds good. So for anybody need any help, for time being, on this subjects, okay, so please come back to me, and Christine, maybe I can try to help you to get the companies make a design slim, okay, and to add some features, like we are talking about, the speech recognition and all. Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, but do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? Yeah. Hmm. Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance? Sure. Doesn't really tell us. So not really this one we are talk Yep. Individual actions. It says user so I'm supposed to do the components concept, supposed to work on the user interface concept, and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. Mm-hmm. And specific instructions will be sent by our coach. I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process, that's my suggestion. No, I'm just thinking in terms of time, if Yes, now I'm objecting. Okay, that will be great. And I'll send you the minutes of. You can object if you want to I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause our meeting time has run out. She's objecting. No, I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? It takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the thinking more about features that we actually do want, but I guess Sure. We still have. Right. Somebody else has go to use this room, and, we can't hang out here and talk about this, so Thank you very much. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay, what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break, okay, then we can discuss furthermore, okay, with our areas, and then we will come back again in the next meeting. So thanks for coming and I'll send you minutes of meeting, and please put all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information. Okay? Okay. So let's go for lunch then. Agreed. Thank you.",
