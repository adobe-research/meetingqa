    "displayText": "Sixteen times zero. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I'm not having crashes at the moment. So what I'm having is so we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why the time synching up between the relative time in a in a sort of in a in a summarised section and the absolute time didn't correspond and stuff, and we found it was some stupid at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid Java thing about if you actually if you have two objects and you say object if you say A equals B, they actually reference to the same thing. So any changes you make to one are made to the other, and if you do that around five corners, you lose track of it and you suddenly wonder why that value is zero. Yeah. And it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway So we figured out it's interesting, why don't I have a screen here now actually that's new, but that's okay. It's doing different things all the time. This is the first time that actually the but that should be okay. I'll be able to but last time I pressed that key combination, everything went wrong, I think I'll be able to do it just fine on the screen. So that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen, which I usually it might just be at this point. There's sometimes a point to loading, not usually that long. Let's see. Anyway, so let's just see what happens. In the end we did get it working before. See I get. Yeah. Ah, so now I'm having a complete mess of split split screens and stuff. I think last time yes, but that's not what we want, is it? So but I think if I this is a log out command and usually it resets this Amazing strange colour combinations I see in front of me at the moment. We somehow always get it working, but in different ways every time. So that kept us basically from doing anything else for quite some time in the last days because we were hunting down that stupid error. I got it fixed in whatever one hour or something, so at the moment the program is sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to what the error was. Dave, I think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct. But that could be because of the input data. It seems to just take the first utterances more or less. Does it? I have to check that out. Yeah. If you first if you read through the summaries, they read suspiciously fluent, as in people's questions and answers. Hmm. And then if you plot them on the screen where they are at the moment, they seem to Yes. It depends which data you use as well because if you use the data where they're all really high, it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds. So maybe that's where the problem is coming from. But I'll check it out anyway. Yeah. So this is when you start shifting around your laptop to think that it gets somehow less sloped on the screen. So I'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest. I'm gonna show this, just what we have at the moment but it not gonna look very different from what we had last time. Don't ask him what happened to the promise that you'll get your script where you can use your own stuff because actually that was sort of ready but then we sort started trying to get something more working and then we got into big problems. So at the moment again we should be at a state where people can load their own okay. Yeah. I've got time now. For the next couple of days I'll do some on it, 'cause I was just too busy last week. Yeah. Thing is at the moment it's just really bad for me. But from Monday on I can just do twenty four seven for this one until it until it's due. But until Monday it's gonna be really bad. I can probably help people if they have problems with getting what we have running now. But Okay. So I'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff. What's that that's creeping over the other screen? I know. Huh? Doesn't look great, does it? Eek. It doesn't. But sometimes you have to take whatever you get and then just see how far that gets you. That's really weird 'cause it's just started creeping over. So let's perhaps in the meantime talk about the numbers we assign to the dialogue acts because I didn't know that you left out those who don't have words. Uh-uh. So I just extracted the actual dialogue numbers, and the problem is it's perhaps more dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just devote numbers and make new sure, but for all those measures that are based on words I can automatically just throw those where it's nothing. As long as the two correspond then it's fine. But those dialogues acts thirty three in the first meeting, they have a duration, even though they don't have a word. Mm. So for my other measures I get them and I don't I would have to look for every single write a programme that looks for everything a number and does the mapping for that. Right, I see. Okay. So would it be would it be easier if there's a reference file with the actual real ID and the corresponding number? Yes. There's index files already. So is there some already? Yeah. Why is that? In the raw text index directory. Mm-hmm. And it allows you to map between the different IDs. So would that solve the problem basically? I just wanted to why do you think it's necessary at all to do that? Because the whole programme works on them being numbered at the moment. And it's a problem if there's no But actually I think there is something in the audio, shouldn't there? It'd be a lot of word for really no extra feature gain at all. Even though there's not a word, I think in the audio there will be something at that point because it has a duration. Or do you think it could appear in the summary? Hmm? If it's something in the audio that's just like a noise, then we don't want it. I guess. Cause we can't show it in the display. So you cut it out. Yeah. They've been cut out the ones that don't have any words. Yeah. Suppose. But would that not happen at some sorry, I'm jumping in. Would that not happen at summarisation anyway even if they're with the ones that have no words and then not have really low information density or something? Huh. I don't I don't know. You 'cause the thing is it depends if we want to have it display the whole thing at once. Hmm. Cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway. If you left them in hopefully it wouldn't affect the way the programme works. But why do you have a special for those? No, I guess not. In the programme, they're not in the raw text files. It's just. Hmm. That's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it. Seems a bit stupid. But I can fit 'em back in if. It's just a question I wanted to raise. Either way. Either way is fine by me as long as the two things tie up. As far as I'm concerned it doesn't really matter whether those are in or out. Wouldn't you think that if we just write the programme the way that even in the way that it displays everything, it still leaves those out. If we those a special information density ID, or if you just put something like that. No, minus one or something. And then just make sure that summary even in the in the most summarised mode just never puts them in. Certainly possible. It might be a problem for me at the stage right now because I based everything on not having those. Hmm. Actually 'cause the TFIDF wouldn't make any sense with So maybe we should just omit them then. It's a my topic segmenter doesn't like blank lines either. What I also did was having two people annotate the first meeting, and so they didn't annotate the spaces and everything would mess up. Mm. I think if I had spaces for the new values when I went to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore. So I don't know. Okay, so maybe we should leave them out then. Kay, shall we take a quick look at the current Sorry. Okay by how did you assign the dialogue act number? What I could do is work further with what I've got now and then just when I have the final formula ready, I could apply to the new stuff. That would be okay. Did you take the one you found in the XML file and just, put it there? No, my what my TFIDF is based on Colin's data. Or did you Okay. So I end up with the same. The bar is working now. Okay, you end up with. Yeah. It is actually. Okay. It is it is jumping now. Cool. Sorry. Another issue was that. So the summary is probably okay 'cause it does the job. It did summarise just now. It's just it's summarising stupidly, but at least it's jumping. Yeah. Is it still the old old TFIDF? Shall Yes, and in fact at the moment I don't even know which of the two I'm summarising over. Okay. Do you know are we so at the moment the configuration is that word importance file is test three and TDIDF file is test two. I can't remember which one it is at the moment. Yep, that those names are the TFIDF is fine, but word importance is completely misleading, it's not word importance at all. I've just I've just switched them around. So I have no clue what we're actually doing at the moment. Especially since I've just switched them around anyway. But that's okay. I by the way, I read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type. It's it's going on about this fancy called geometric mean, which effectively just means multiplying them. But I have some good information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors, because it's for something very similar. Somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together. Mm-hmm. And there is a good justifiable reason why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs. So there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way, but still a way that we can sort of justify. Mm-hmm. And we can quote stuff on that. Is it very complex or is it just multiplying together. Sure, we? No, it's multiplying them and putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one one minus the power of something, and that's sort of and they've plotted some graphs about where they show one going from zero to the one and the other going zero to one and how the landscape changes and how the parameter changes, how it works. To a power. Yeah. I've seen that before. Yeah. So it's quite good. I've seen that before actually. So that's probably seeing that we're probably not gonna go into whatever base blah blah blah Markov model blah blah blah about combining them, that's probably what we go at. No. Hmm. Now this is still not ideal at the moment, Dave. It's sort of it's overrunning it okay, so at the moment we're that far that if I now click onto a segment, hits it's just wait, sorry, I just re-sized it a bit. Yeah. Ah, it's still working like it should do. Hmm. Who has that going? So it's like the values are sort of hard-coded for the screen sizes in DICE and my screen's smaller. So let's see, I was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment. We probably have to make the segment lines a lot bigger. So then I I did I get a new summarisation? I didn't actually see. So let me check a different one. Yeah. So see it's a different text. And you see it it's running through it. So it did work. And also you see the indicator in where we are is jumping. Yeah. So it's it's skipping stuff. Now I don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing the words mm and exactly, exactly, right, sure. Mm. That is ancient data though. So Having said that, it's picking out some interesting stuff. This seems probably this is again probably the opposite of what we want. So it's probably some value that you have to one divide by the value of something. But Yes, but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of all important words in the universe. We're looking at atlas, you'd expect to score quite high. Maybe, but atlas, you'd have thought it'd be quite high. Yes, but it's probably just because if you look at the other one, this is just their best sentence for having function words in a row sort of and every other this one is sort of developing a big infrastructure. Huh. So maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment. I don't know. But we have some summary working and that's a good basis to start from. If I promise now that you'll get something where you can put your own data and that's sort of ringing a bit hollow. I'm just quite surprised it all actually worked, because we've been working on incomplete versions that haven't worked for a long time, and like to see it all come together. Yeah. Hmm. Still it it's might be having some problem. I think this one over-ran just before. So we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end, so Dave, can you make the promise even I'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get Okay. The first thing I'll do is make a load box for selecting a file and a script that sets the class path so it can be run with just a script. Yeah. So class path is this long. So at the moment I've hard-coded it to just taking one tenth of the number of utterances which were in the original selection. But we'll have parameter for that. Yeah. Yeah. It actually it gives you an error if you put it to twenty, because there's some things in there which are shorter than twenty. And twenty. And if you select those than it's having an. We need to add some sanity checking in some of the stuff. But I think a proportional one is probably not bad idea, an absolute length is sort of a bit strange because that means that some utterances will not be changed in length. I know but we had that discussion before and I'm confused myself about what I think about it. Yeah. So the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal, but that's something we have to sort out. But this is working in general. Does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue, as in what date is it today, what date do we have to have this presented, what day of the week is that and issues like that. Hmm. So the presentation is now two weeks from today. Presentation is exactly in two weeks. Yeah. Kay. One week from today I shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and and everything and shall then throw myself into new slavery. And I think we should start to think about evaluation by now. If you want to have some people but it's just three days between the presentation and the. But we don't we don't need it evaluated for the presentation, do we. But. Is it? cause it was moved back, wasn't it. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. Hmm. No really? So I don't know if we're Do you think we're gonna have time? Yeah. And the report. Yeah. I can rope people in to to doing it, a few people at least. I think we should take the time because I think it will be But we'll also have to write the thing in that time. As long as we design it before-hand, I think we can probably manage to actually do it in the three days after. Is it not is it not only two days anyway? You're talking about the user evaluation. Writing the report won't be so bad? How long is it expected to be? I don't know. But it's fifty percent of the mark. I know, but if everyone is managing three pages for their bit, then that that's a big report then. No. And stuff. But evaluation. Ah. We should probably write some user documentation 'cause I bet that will get us marks. Yeah. You think? They'd love that kind of stuff. Yeah. I think so too. We should probably inquire about that or integrate tool tips that would be visible. We'll just write, little help files or something. Yeah. That'd probably be quite good. I've got a basic search working now. It's it's got a user interface. So. Have you Java doc ed it? No. And also where is it? I'm still in my directory, but I can put it in your directory. Okay, 'cause the code version in the group directory is not the right one. I've not been using that. Yeah. Yeah. I've just been taking the class files from your directory. Okay. Having said that, Dave, if we want, we could probably go back to the group directory and just use this trick. It really seems to be all about starting in the directory. In directory. But if the two of us are just working on it it doesn't make a difference 'cause I've already mounted your directory now. And probably Mm. Okay. We should wait till we have it ready for you guys to use. Then we'll put it back in the group directory. So I'll try and do that today. Cause I've got time today. And as long as I don't run into problems I don't see it taking too long. How about the summarisation again, you wanted to base it on sentence length as well, and I've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment. So Okay. In that case it's probably just that's probably fine. But if we do it twice, it wouldn't make too much sense. It would buy us something. Don't know how exactly we will want to implement your We can. I'm not sure how much should be done in the programme because I don't know. I think it should probably be done off-line, the basic combining of all the factors. What? If it's just multiplying to numbers, it can be done in the programme 'cause then we can because what we could do is have a slide bar where we can adjust this value. Sure. Actually if you can figure out a way how basically a general way because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that. How we can just have a slide bar which we can read and write to, which is in a frame of that type. That would be good. It shouldn't be difficult, should it? Should just be but it might be more let's see, it you could if you're lucky, you probably have just to extend that class and then you can work with that value, but if you're unlucky it might be quicker to just write a very simple string component which is just just a bar. Hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it. That'd be quite nice. I bet you can just add it to the panel. What I bet that's a pre-made Swing component, that little slider, and all you do is add it to a panel. Because it would be good to have two different ones to play around with, one for controlling the length of the summary, and another one for the merging factor, if we do it that way with the CHI metric. Yeah. Can you send me a link to that paper so that I'll implement that in summarizer. It's just a single formula effectively. How is the audio thing going? Is that you've probably not had time to work on that. No I've not looked at it. Last week I just not done anything. But can't see it taking long again. Kay, it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done sort of at the moment I'm saying Dave, can you do that. So that's not ideal. But to be honest, I did like nothing really on it last week. So And I've got time today, tomorrow and probably Friday. Oh. Okay. So Mm-hmm. Cause I think in the end the audio is a very important component of it. Just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we have everything working but just if The speech tools. It's just annoying because I need to do that on a DICE machine. So I can't get them to compile under Windows. Yeah. And most the DICE machines don't have working sound cards. So No idea. Hmm. Is there any way for X forwarding sound? Cause that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you. Yeah. Seeing that it's over broad-band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay, it would probably broad-band-wise, band-width-wise, probably work out. I'm not sure how it if it if it can do sound or not. I've no idea. But it's probably and not a simple thing. But what I can do is I'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it will just go. And as long as I can test the script once and it's working fine, I can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines. Hmm. Are you not creating files anywhere, sort of real files? Yes. So actually, I know what I can do. So that you can do on a DICE machine independent of. I can then I can change the script. So if I'm using my one at home, I can just add SSH stuff in to evoke the sound tools on DICE and then copy 'em back. One problem with SSH ing in general is that the only gateway machines, they hate you for doing anything on them. Yeah. And at least I haven't found one to directly in a single step sort of SSH and then SSH again. Hmm. Actually I guess if you put SSH and you can give a command outright with SSH. So if that command is SSH again and if you that would require that you have all your key files set correctly, which I haven't, because it always fucks up on my system. Yeah. Maybe if you get that working, then you should be able to directly go into another machine. I'm sure I can figure out some way to do it anyway. If it comes to it, I'll just install NetBeans and stuff on my Linux machine and work on that. Yeah. Cause a a primitive version of the sound to have relatively soon would be good. I think okay. To be honest there won't be a primitive in between stage. Just it'll just work hopefully. Okay. Okay. Okay. In theory at least anyway. Hmm. Okay, good. So to come back to the problem we had before, so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogeneously high in its importance rating that it just sort of then, everything else being equal, it took the first ones more or less. But now it's working better because now it's on a much more evenly distributed The most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation 'cause that way that's sort of like it it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated even though it's actually in terms of calculation it's not much heavier. I wonder if we should do something like dropping the bottom third, then re-mapping the lowest remaining one to zero and scaling it like that 'cause you get a much nicer distribution like that. But generally about standard deviation? I've not used it to do that before, but. It's a it's a very simple simple it's basically just the average of mean square differences from the mean or something, which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only only once you have the mean what In one go? There is a way of calculating it calculating it cumulatively, but I can't remember it. I've derived that myself. I didn't find it so I did it myself and it took me a day with the formula. Yeah. But then I'm slow at maths. So the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever, one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviations or something, then whatever the data is like, it would always normalise. That's probably quite a good idea. It's not the simplest. But that's the most professional way I can think about it. That would indirectly also drop stuff. That would drop whatever is below or above. Yeah. That's probably quite sensible. So if you find that formula, that would be good. Otherwise I can see if I can still understand, I did it in my programme. It's really stupid. The standard deviation formula just requires you to have the mean initially, and that makes some things exactly twice as computationally expensive, and there is a way of doing it cumulatively. I can't remember it off-hand, but I know there is one. Hmm. So that's one possible way of doing that. And that's just in the loading stage, right? But it could be fine, running over the data twice probably is okay. That should actually be fine, especially in the worst case we just introduce a small hour glass. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, we only gonna present this once and we can probably just sort of start it up before the presentation starts. So if we shouldn't at all be worried about it's actually it's quite beautiful, it's like if you want a programme only to run once and only a part of it, you don't worry if it crashes afterwards, if it wastes all the resources, if it formats the hard disk in the end. Mm. Anyway, I'm rambling on. No, it does not if I changed it. Never closes the process when he does it now. Hmm. I just So You would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running. They used to not close the process when you click the cross. Does anyone know anything about which DICE machines have sound cards and how to find them? No. Cause the thing is we can like this at the moment is working because it has a sound card. The interesting thing is that because it's structure of this, it isn't enough to just say if you don't have a sound card, you don't have sound. At least I think that's what I remember our problem was, that. It refuses to load the clock for some reason. Mm-hmm. No. So there is ways to get around it, but the problem is So you basically we have to we have to have two code versions then, one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on. I don't know why. Because you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card. So there isn't a simple way to just tell which ones the sound card machines are and just to use sound card machines is there. That makes it really quite difficult for us if we want to test our stuff first have to fight for our computers without cards. No, but I guess if you trust in Dave's summary for the audio, just putting all these things into sound then, having a written summary. Sure. I I just care for the written one. You you still get the written one and the display. Does that work without the sound cards? So the. The only thing you don't get is the clock. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I think, Dave, really the easiest way is if you just make a sound card and a non sound card version of it. Because but then that means that the girls can't test it. I don't think we should bother 'cause we'll run it on a sound card version. That's the problem. Yes, but without the clock actually you're right, it doesn't strictly have to do any movement in it. Yes they can. All that happens is it refuses to load load the clock. You still get the display in the summary. So the, move but you can still click on the segments and that'll still work, won't it? But we have to comment stuff out for that, I think. At the moment if you click on a segment, it automatically sets the whole clock thing going and stuff. So we have to comment out stuff. So that's what I'm saying, that there is we could make it that a flag, couldn't we? Okay. We could just make that a run-time flag and then make a few ifs and say if Yes, there is. Yeah. There must be a way of detecting whether the clock's loaded. In fact there is. You can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch, and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems just that the overwhelming majority of DICE machines don't have sound card. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, do you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that I worked on last week? Or do we have anything more on this? No, nothing much to talk about this. So apart from a search box and the similarity thing once that kicks off, which is gonna be horrible, but this is more or less in the end, this is very similar to what our product will look like in the end, seeing that realistically with the given time frame we're not gonna do amazing new things from now on. Hmm. Yeah. So we'll hopefully be able? Perhaps my list of agreements. Perhaps my list of agreements somewhere. List of agreements? If we find them good enough We wanted to provide that in an extra list saying probably agreement. We could put those on display. Okay. Okay. Instead of a list, what about putting it in the display? I think it would be good Dave's right. It could be good in the display to annotate them in the display if we can. For example. Yeah. We could just make Not just yet, but that's actually that's probably the only I can say I can do this week because I'll do it in an inefficient way. Can you click on a point in time in display and jump to there yet? Okay. Cause that'd be pretty good. I'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they're clicked on. But I think, Dave, what we should do is that the time click of the clock, I think that's changeable. And I think we should probably increase that. Because at the moment it's zero point one seconds and that's just there is actually there are some background noise when it's working and I think that is because it's like doing so much every time. No, I don't get that on my machine. It's probably because I'm not sure if you have the version where the display is actually updating up here when it's moving on. No, I don't. No. So yes, it is because my display is programmed inefficiently. But I think with the given time constraints it's probably easier instead of making a very efficient display code to just make the time make the clock whatever, zero point five seconds or something. Okay. Do you want the monitor? Mm-hmm. As long as you can skip more accurately than the time steps, that's fine. Cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off. If I can skip more accurately, then That's probably because it's coming from my resolution and you have a much higher resolution. If you want to jump to a point, you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second. By half second you'll miss words. Are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers? I think so. Okay. And also displaying the speakers before an utterance. Hmm. It's a bit small, but I don't know why that is. Okay. I can I can do that. Hmm. Strange. So Again I think that's probably a good part if we had a slide bar initially where we could dynamically adapt the threshold of what we so maybe it's just good to have some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something, and just sort of all our fiddle factors. Perhaps because it's wide screen or something. Yeah. But okay, what you see here in this part is? No mouse. There it is. Here is a list of the most important or, most probable words that occur in agreement. So the number in the first brackets is so I run it on all the BED, BMR and BRO meetings to learn it. So the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the utterances that were annotated as agreements by the dialogue act agreement. And the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the rest. And the first number in every line is how much more often that is per same text length. So the words that it gives it are look quite good, I think. It's true, interesting, exactly, correct, super and so on. And then I ran it on the first meeting, getting the so what's in the brackets in this window here is the utterances. And the moment it can't make any differences you get the same value for every utterance that is exactly or every utterance that is sure. And for the longer utterances I just look how often one of these words is in there and simply add it up. So that should in principle favour longer utterances. And, so these numbers here, one or zero, these here, that's the dialogue act labels if they're annotated as agreement, they're not zero here. So here for those that get a very high score, they're mostly not zero, and some of those who are zero are still very good. I definitely agree it's a nice kind of agreement that we probably want to have. And when you get further down, you see those with very low score also have no agreements. Here they are. A lot of zeros. Of what we display. Yeah. Yeah. Because it depends, we could in some cases we could put it as a feature and say, dynamically We wouldn't call it threshold, we would sort of like the granularity of decision or something like it. Obviously we'll hide that in the presentation. But we don't want I don't think we want to have exposed to the user doing things like adding the threshold of which agreements we display. Yeah. Hmm. And, and and everything above that threshold I could then add the utterance where it occurs, just put a certain graphical item, like a handshake or something cool. Decision. Yeah. Yeah. That does look quite promising, doesn't it. Right. Right. So it looks quite good, I think. Hmm. So that's what I got for agreement. Then for disagreement I did also, but it's a bit more difficult because there's so little disagreement. Mm. So you again see the list. But it's much shorter and it's much worse. So you can have happy faces and angry faces. Yes, it I was just thinking the same, it's so tempting, like we'll we'll have yellow we'll have yellow smilies and yellow angry faces. Smilies. Ah, beautiful. Here at the list of utterances it gets us for the first meeting. Didn't somebody say that actually a lot of agreements have actual words which should suggest disagreement? I think perhaps that's why we have but rated so high here. That makes sense. So will that produce basically an agreement and a disagreement score for every dialogue act? Or think. I think. Yeah. Think is also rated higher in the non-agreement than in the agreement. Yeah. There is some funny things. Yes. That's effectively what I'm getting here. So could you put them in the same format as the other data? It's it's exactly this thing, but just I would just have to re-scale this factor here. And I'll make us to read it in. And this is the dialogue act number. So I can just give it to you in the format you want. Right, okay. So I could probably read it from that file already. So it will just And then score, this was just for showing it. My preferred would be dialogue act number, then you can put both the scores in one file. Huh? You can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier. If they're corresponding for each thing, they should be right. Yeah. So for each utterance you have one agreement and one disagreement score. Agreement and one disagreement. Yeah. Something like it. Okay. So I'll make it part of the get measure thing. So you can just get it with a flag using get measure. Okay. The one where we. So you know how zero is TFIDF. One is the I've called it word importance, but that's a really misleading name. Yeah. Yeah. What, if you can if you introduce a sort of a static, what's it called, public static int. So basically that's Java's type of a constant, and give them names, like so zero TDIDF, one that probably makes the code a lot more readable for everybody who's playing around with it. Probably. You know you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. So just whatever, three means agreement value, and then I'd just write something agreement, and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on. Okay. One problem I used to have is with all the yeahs. Because obviously they all write it the same. So I was thinking perhaps looking at the acoustic measures I have. So for example at my F zero deviation. Hmm. But by now I just had a look at the data and actually the average F zero deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones than for the negative ones. There is a difference, but it's probably not significant enough to really make use of it. But I perhaps investigate some time still to. But I would also. The problem is occurring not only as an agreement, but really frequently as an encouragement as well, isn't it. And my my hypothesis was that if it's really agreement, it will sound different if it than into if it is just a back-channel. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what, I think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway. Mm. So probably it doesn't make much of a difference. Because I think this thing No, but But the fact that different ones have the same number in itself isn't a problem, is it? But that has nothing to do with the threshold. Because you have you don't have it only with yeahs. You have it also with words that are much higher ranked. You have the same problem for example with yep is much higher ranked, because it occurs less often in the training thing. No. It's only if they're used in different contexts. So if for every yep you'd be sure that it's an agreement, than that wouldn't be a problem. So you're saying that you're not sure if every yep is an agreement or. Yes, I I know that not every yep is an agreement. Because this right, yep and okay things are typically also back-channels. What's the highest ranked one that that kind of problem occurs with? Cause if it's below about 'cause I saw there's ones up in the eighties, wasn't there. If it's below fifty, it's probably or exactly no they're all but one. But we would throw a lot away that are quite good. Cause we on the display we probably take quite high. If you if you would set it off. So it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked. So over over how many different over which length is this? Now this is so the third column is the utterance where it occurs, right? Yes. Okay, so I think we really do have to put the threshold quite quite high then, because Yes, 'cause I was just I was just checking, how far apart are they, and at the moment that's definitely not a good thing to display if they're an average ten ten utterances apart or something. Yeah. Otherwise you'd get icons all over the place. Anyway. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So we want probably want to take a threshold at least of fifty or sixty, just as a looking at that. I think for this meeting there were what was it, like around or ninety annotated agreements or agreement dialogue acts. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. To we probably won't want to display ninety. So the best ones are definitely those on the first screen here. We'd want to rate them as how important they were, wouldn't we. Yeah. So it could just Mm-hmm. Again, I'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have a control which we can vary in the and then just sort of because that's in the end how it's gonna be evaluated. And see how it turns out. In the end this is gonna we're gonna present it and say so our it shows disagreements. And then we see what looks good and what looks I think probably it looks credible like an if every sort of every topic segment has or or something in between the three and five agreements, but not more. An agreement at the end. Okay. Or probably maybe less but not much less and actually the I think there doesn't have to be one in everything. Yeah. Probably have to plot them 'cause this is just added by different speakers for example. They are immediately following one another. But it's just two speakers agreeing I think. Same for this one here, for these two here. So we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one. They will be optically merged anyway. Yeah. Yes, but maybe in an expensive way or maybe in a stupid looking way though. Yeah. I'm I was just thinking that it can probably be done on display level. And we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together, it's looking quite good though. Okay. That was just what I only keep the stuff I actually need on it and then I clean it up every, But actually this all here is NLSSD because it was data that didn't fit on my quota anymore. This one crashed. Mine just crashed which is bad. It probably just it kept on playing and now reached some whatever. I think it's always really funny that when you look at people's computers who don't use the computer much, their desktop's really tidy, and when you work with people who use it all the time there's stuff everywhere. So mine's like that as well. Yeah. My God. Okay. So Toby, you wanted to have keywords for each topic segment or something? Yeah. Who provides the values for that? No one yet. Yeah. No one. I think sort of the bottom line and which might well end up what it's gonna be like is that we take the single highest ranked utterance and put that as a as a title, like realistically looking at this from the the time we have left to do this and stuff. Right. Yeah. Because what I do is having values for each segment at the moment. So I could just extract the highest ones for each segment. That could be good. I don't know if that's good or bad. There? It could be at least I could provide some value. Maybe even on a is that on a is that on a word basis, would that be single words? Or would that be 'Cause check out what they would be like on a word basis. It doesn't matter to me. I could do both. Okay. Maybe actually if there's one word which is very typical, it's probably some word because that's the only time that was spelled with three A and stuff. I think that actually that might be a problem of the whole annotation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they transcribe stuff like that, then we probably can't. Mm. Same thing with the yoohoos and so on. Cause that's when we're thinking sometimes, why is mm high. But then probably it's the only time that mm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff. Mm. But if single I have dictionaries. Maybe we should download a dictionary and check our utterances before we listen to make sure that they're actually real words. Do you see what I mean? If it's just like I have arbitrarily long lists from the British National Corpus of when usually let's say at least they do it consistently enough that I think you can filter them out fairly well. That do not include mm. Hmm. See how it turns out. If they look good, then that's a good way of doing it as any, I suppose. Yeah. So if if the single best one word for a segment is interesting, that would be really good. Hmm. Seem to be Use a random. Actually, what I think you should do is take the highest three or four and then just merge them together into one utterance. It wouldn't make any sense, but it'd give you an idea of what they're actually talking about, if you see what I mean. Yeah. Especially when the segments are really long. Yeah. That was sort of in the original of then, the nice fancy drawings that we gave Steven. That was part of it that sort of within the segment you had these sub-segments and each of them had different words and whatever happened to our dreams? Uh. I don't think we're gonna have time for that. Are there assignments. No, I don't think we have. Which is a shame 'cause it would've been cool. Yeah. Hmm. Are we gonna have time to make it display a whole archive of meetings? Or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings and you'll hold up different ones? At the moment it doesn't really care how many meetings it's displaying. Hmm. Poor man's solution is probably gonna be to have a list so you are think of loading them all at once. Just draw a big black line on the borders, I think. Hmm. You can if you want to. Yeah. It's 'Cause it it can display from any utterance to any other utterance. Yeah. It doesn't really Do they? See, at the moment the dialogue IDs just they start at zero for each meeting, they don't run continuously. Yeah. Ah. But you you'd like them to run continuously. I'd prefer them drawn continuously. Yeah. I can change that. Okay, then you will provide a file with all the mappings from the old ones to the unique ones. Even though we 'Kay. Just to change the index files as well. Okay. Because that way, all we have to do to display more than one meeting is have a harder boundary drawn. Yeah. I think that the drawing has to be changed anyway, it's not ideal at the moment. So if performance-wise it generally works fine for the display it shouldn't make much of a difference, 'cause I think everything in the display code is just from the first until the last one displayed. So if if the other performance is okay, then we should really just load the whole thing in. See, that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has. One thing we will have to do is we want we'd really want a different behaviour if we clicked on a whole meeting than a segment. So if there's more than one meeting displayed, if you click even on the segments of that meeting, I think it should re-initialize and display that just that meeting. So I'm not I'm not sure how easy that would be to do. So initially the display Yes. It just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting, doesn't it. That's the only knowledge it would need. Yeah. But anyway, we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else. Yeah. That's probably fairly simple to do actually if we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as you display more than one meeting. Yeah. That'll get sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well. Yeah. We then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy, but that in the worst case it will just be a static sort of arrow up button in the right hand topper corner of the display, and you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again. Yeah. Mm. But for that at the moment my display code needs that thing to work, the one no, that's working at the moment anyway, the one that I just say give me one hundred values over that length and then you're internally okay, but but that's okay, as long as my display I was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments. It's not done the very clever way, but it does work. But now no, but it doesn't have to. Mm-hmm. Even now it doesn't have to. Okay, that's all details. So Dave, can you just turn this what we have right now in. Basically do a code for ease on it. Do you want me to put a search in soon? I'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently. No. And if you could document it for me, that's probably enough for me to add it in. And if anyone feels that they have free time, this is a joke, one thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things which I haven't found out about it is how to do tool tips in an arbitrary way in in Swing graphic displays. Unless you want to do it. Yes. We'll work on it. But my code, I've not documented the programme manager class. So though it's a bit hairy at the moment, isn't it. Uh-huh. Now there is simple ways of doing tool tips over a given element, like if you have a button and you just give it a tool tip text. But there is means of doing tool tips that just I I put my mouse over. Let's say I put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is. Hmm. And that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display in the way that just when the mouse is over it, but I haven't figured out how it works, and that's something that probably so if everyone is ever bored or anyone feels that they can do that Yes, but the thing is it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip. Mm-hmm, yes. Okay, so probably what you'd want to do is detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component. Because it automatically displays at the correct position when you hover. There seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or. You might nor really want to be creating a new one every time you move the mouse. Anyway, I haven't looked much into that. So if if anybody looks into that, then let me know. Otherwise I'll start looking into it as soon as I have time again. But if anybody. I'll have a look through some of my Java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there. I found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding, like I saw half-page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and I didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that. Mm. So if anybody gets any good samples of that Never. Anyways, that is that it for now? Yeah. Is that version all in the Okay. No, but I'm going up Appleton Tower now and I have my external hard disk. So I can. Cool. So I'll start working on that in half an hour or something and it will be the Okay. Is there any DICE machines in this building? Mm-hmm. Freely accessible for me. Mm. Can you show me where because I'm actually not going to Appleton Tower at the moment. Yeah. So then I don't have to go up and down. Actually no, but I have to go there anyway and put a piece of paper on two machines where some stuff of mine is running on. And I think I'll just kick in full time for NLSSD next week, 'cause there's nothing I have to do then. Apart from Cognitive Modelling, which I think I'll just do in five hours, three hours. You take a look at that? Hmm. But not too detailed. By the way how much time do we have for the presentation? Hmm. I might just not go for the last question because usually the last question takes half the time and gives you five percent or something like Okay. Yes, we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week. We really need to get in contact with the other group and see if they want to do a joint evaluation. We could do that. So you need to get their email addresses. I think they're on the NLSSD web page. Are they? Hmm. Really? At least their names, and if we have their names then we can get their email. That'd be handy. We can get them. Okay. So you do is sending them an email. Cause I was hoping that Steve would mention it Ian 'cause we've mentioned it to him so many times. Mm. But he obviously hasn't. No, maybe he has mentioned it to them, but they just never talked to us. We didn't talk to them. Yeah. So It's sort of coming as a shock to me now because I was sort of in this mindset. I first knew there's a lot of time between the presentation and the report. And then I knew now the presentation is shifted. But the correlation between those two facts, the interdependencies, there's some fancy planning language about that. But Yes, it's probably some version of the frame problem. There's the frame problem. Frame problem. Hasn't been clear to me. No, I think it's coming together not bad at the moment actually. Yeah. Don't know. Probably as long as we need. Yeah. But I don't know. But more twenty minutes or more like an hour? Half an hour or half an hour probably. I reckon that But if you just present the functionality of the thing, if you're not don't think this presentation is about the internal working. I can't see it going on for an hour to be honest. If you if you present the components of what it's based on, then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it, I guess. It's question. Then My computer? So. I thought it was a demo basically. Hmm. So for a demo, realistically since everything in this university sort of works in one hour slots and stuff. I think. So if it's two groups then it probably it's gonna be roughly half an hour-ish. Half an hour. Yeah. And ten minutes of that would be probably set up time as well. Hmm? Ten minutes of that will probably be set up time as well. No, why is this is gonna be so bad. There's gonna be some small but the performance is really bad at the moment on that one though. We maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come. Hmm. Plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop then, wouldn't we? I could probably get my computer in if I could get someone to give me a lift. Mm. I know a couple of people with cars. It may be a good idea to do that. Let's see. Did it it could just be fluent on the laptop for all I know. Could we guarantee that it'd work? At the moment it's not too bad apart from the sound is stuttering and that's because of the laptop. But we can only really judge that once we have sound files. cause I wouldn't need to bring a monitor or anything, I'll just need to bring the box. Hmm. I'm pretty sure I could nick a lift off someone. How fast is yours, Vera? It doesn't have Linux. Mm-hmm. So Mm. Net would run on anything. But Yes. Or J Builder. In fact you won't even you shouldn't even need either as long as you got Java installed. No, that's true. I've been able to run it without. That's true. Yeah. Virtual Machine should be fine. But but but that all relies on finding some way of getting the speech tools to do their job. Crap, I forgot about that. See that's 'cause that's the thing, like that would rely on I just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in No no no no, wherever this is going, it doesn't sound good. Hmm. Cygwin maybe? In Cygwin. Mm-hmm. No, but Cygwin should run the Java as well. He can use my laptop sort of as a as a server as a sound server, but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this. A sound server. No, the way Java works is that I think it'll run on their DICE machine if we're doing it in if we should definitely test it the day before. Hopefully. Yeah. I'm sure he'll let us test it out before we do it. Yeah. Kay. Dave, are you gonna make something primitive that people can load their data in? Yep, I'll do that today. And I'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory. Yeah. And I'll send around the email when it's done. Yeah. I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the to make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card. There's quite a bit you have to comment out for that, which is stupid because the. It'll be the bit where it creates the clock. Or is there stuff in the display as well? No, but the thing is the display calls methods which probably expect some I think if the display itself isn't doing anything clocky, as long as in the programme manager everything clocky is removed, but it might be worthwhile to check how much work it would be to do it over a flag, 'cause then in the end 'cause otherwise we always have two code versions, and people might be changing the wrong one. Okay. We shouldn't even need a flag. You should be able to do it with exceptions. This is kinda not exact case that exceptions are made for really. Okay. Okay. That's true. I know that if you don't do it with the exceptions, crashes. That's what figured out. If you don't have a sound card it crashes, even if you don't use sound. Yeah. Okay, cool. Dave, see in the programme manager, do you have a method to set the current ID so it'll update the display? Mm-hmm. Cause that's what I'm gonna need when I'm getting search results. No, it's gonna have to do something a bit more complicated than that. What it will have to do is de-register everything as time handlers and then update and then re-register them. Hmm. I think the display has some method for it. Right. I'm not actually for the programme manager then to call. I'm not actually a hundred percent sure what it's called, but the display has some method where you tell it where to start and where to end. Or there's gonna be something. As far as I've got at the moment, I've made a results class that's got the ID and the stuff. Okay. Have you got a component for displaying lists of matches? Cause that'd be pretty useful. Yeah. Yep. Cool. I'm working on it. Okay, it's not too hard to do. All you have to do is de-register everything that's a time handler first before you add the stuff in. Right. But depends what behaviour we want. Do we want when you click on a search result, we definitely want that one to appear in the summary. Actually, Dave Dave Dave Okay. And it might not be there. Yeah. I know, I was thinking that might be a problem. No sorry, I was wrong, I was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set select no, it does not. But actually a set selection does everything you want sort of. If you look at select, that's essentially what you wanna do. No, but set selection doesn't update the display though, because it doesn't tell the display which part to display because the display has just called set selection but that only works that at the moment isn't done through our system, that's just done because then the time changes. Does it not? Hmm. But it doesn't matter because if it's jumped in the end text area, then the line'll jump, won't it. So actually a time change would automatically put the position of the display in the right play. Yeah. No, but that's not a good idea, because that could well be outside the displayed area then. And also the real time and play time stuff would change. Yeah. So. So we, need to re-initialize the display then, don't we. No, I think the display has a method for that ready, which is called Anyway, the display has something useful for that. Something which probably starts with the word set. You can start utterance and window end utterance. Okay. Hmm. But we need to do something to ensure that the search result is in the summary that's created. Yeah. So we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an ID. And it will that utterance will always be in the summary. Hmm. Alternatively there's always the method of just giving it a really high score. As a hack, just as long as you then don't probably people wouldn't know. I suppose. But the trouble is that still doesn't guarantee that it'll appear because if you get enough of them that are high scored, it prefers the first ones it sees. Hmm. You could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one. I suppose. But no, it's not it's not a nice way, I'm just saying. You could when you're doing a search, you could just sort of zoom back out so you got the full text for that segment or that meeting, rather than a summary. Cause that's maybe what you'd want if you were a user. Maybe. Probably that actually true that if you're doing a search you're usually not interested in a condensed way but in the full thing anyway. Yes. You could provide that option. But you can achieve the same effect. And otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with the system if you have to re-adjust it to a different zoom level to get better results. Yeah. Probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection, and that would ensure that the search term came up. It would behave strangely in the eyes of the user. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Alright. Yeah. I even though I'm always getting myself confused about this, I think sort of making the summary length thing generally proportion, as a proportional factor of its original length is a good way of going about it. Yeah. Because anything with absolute length's sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to one percent of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length and stuff. So if we're doing it by a proportion then just having one point zero or something makes it very easy to always end up at the actually that's what I've currently like the current code just takes a tenth of the summary length. Exactly. Yeah. So. But we'll have that slider obviously. And that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and show 'cause that's functionality. cause that's very useful thing. That's sort of like your level of the zoom. Of impending doom. Shall we quit here? Yeah. Anything to be discussed? Cause I'm gonna copy that stuff over. Okay. And I'll start work in say two. Will it be done by then? Otherwise you'll definitely see me in MSN.",
