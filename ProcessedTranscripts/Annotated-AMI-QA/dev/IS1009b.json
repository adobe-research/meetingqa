    "displayText": "Okay, is everybody ready? Yeah? I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you. Mm-hmm. Okay? I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. Mm? Yes. Okay you want me to start right now? Mm-hmm. Okay. Could you put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time. Okay. You're participant four. I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh. Kay. Okay, and now I can full screen. Open. Okay, okay. There we go. Okay I think we have introduced ourselves, so the functional requirements is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. And then full screen. Cause that's where my discussion starts. Right since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it. Mm-hmm. I thought that the method I should follow would gather suggestions from everybody, and the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should heat up your motor if should turn on your CD whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility. Kay. So I'll be coming to you frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another, and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that was what I meant there, and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase, we want somebody to see it and think it's, gee I just gotta have that. Mm. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September, 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around, isn't gonna sell for Christmas. Yeah. And then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view. Okay. Okay. So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you, and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle, 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle. Mm mm-hmm. What features. Sellable. Yes. A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. Yes. Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything. I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the TV, the VCR, the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp. Okay, can I at this point interject something? I have to wind up? Sure. We have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered. Okay. The one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext, because that's sort of outdated with the internet, and according to higher management it should only control the TV, mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to to include other things, and they are concerned with the time to market. Okay. Mm-hmm. Complicated, of course. Yeah. Of course. Okay. Okay. And the third thing that they wanna make sure that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product, so that it's easy that that they can be easily identified as a product of of the company, and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out. Okay, so that's something Okay so Okay. Mm-hmm. So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things, so it's only gonna be TV, but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea. Mm 'kay. Okay. Alright, thanks for that. Alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. So those are two things that we definitely do wanna address, we wanna make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use, and then the things about finding it we talked about a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep, and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate. Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay, so, my personal preferences in this project really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Because once there's no be-back, in sales they always say be-backs don't come back. If somebody says, I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is a big word in my book for selling this thing. And, in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so that's why I'm saying, simplicity is good. Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say, twenty five Euros isn't much. And then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign. Yeah. Okay that's about it for me right now. Okay. And who would be next, I guess that would be you. kay. Mm-hmm. You want me to get your slide show up? Sure. Mm-hmm. Thank you. And you are number three? Number two. Number two. Exactly. Okay. Can you make it full screen please? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. No, it's like a you have to press here. The cup cup shape here? Uh-huh. The third. Exactly. There, mm-hmm. So today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Okay. Can you go to the next slide please? Mm-hmm. In a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is a brain of the remote controller. Say a battery it can be an electric supply like you have to connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because remote controller should be you you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a TV or a air conditioner, something like that so. Mm-hmm. A remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote remote controller will send a send a signal, and the TV it should translate that into change the channel or something like that, change the volume control so I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices. Signal. Receive. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Multi-purpose. That's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook. Yo but it's so. Um. Yep. So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages there should be a user user interface like switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So you want, to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions. Mm okay. So can you go to the next slide please? Okay. So I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also, it's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller those we can make fluorescent they'll be light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this this is not a a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. And you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like you if you have kids and all then they'll be playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's hard but I think it's possible so it's okay. That has been eliminated, so that's unfortunately a moot point now. We already eliminated that. Eliminated. Mm-hmm. And different shapes that we can do we can have all animals shapes or comfortable which can fit into your hands so that and colours also, different colours, and No no no, it won't I don't think it will be like, you can have if you want there to be more. Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun shape. It just build a mould basically and. And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget? Mm-hmm colours. To the shape is Do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? It's it's just a shape so it doesn't matter. Yes exactly. As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or yes. Yeah. That is also possible I I. Is that gonna be a possible? Yes. Cause that might help with the marketing. I think we will have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be kind of fun. That will be. Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Silly for children. For children, exactly. An animal or. A doll, or Yes. That's what. Exactly. Yeah. And and the buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive, so I think we need to make some buttons which are intended for two or three operations, like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel, if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so. Mm. I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Yep. Yes. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one. Mm-hmm. You and I, all all four of us we work with computers all the time, changing modes is nothing for us, but people who and that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel, and you don't feel the mode change. It's. Yeah. Okay. A little elderly, a little arthritic hand and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly something else happens not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. Something else. You don't usually. Yeah. So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. Also, different shapes. A triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can develop a tactile sense of it. That will Mm-hmm. Channels. Yeah. Yeah. But we'll get to that with you. And also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities So. Mm, mm-hmm. Yes. That's right. Now that's a good point. Yes. Yeah. And display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock it I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit and we display a clock. That's a good that's a good one, because the clock would be really friendly, and when is your favourite show coming on and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen, and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And then you can just see your remote controller so. Yes. You're sitting there already or maybe you have no other Mm-hmm. That's good, the clock is good. Yeah. Okay. Can you go to the next slide please? The main components we need for it like buttons and underneath that there should be switch. And bulbs. We can have a bulb whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose, then the remote controller should automatically have a light. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source, not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light. Mm-hmm. Maybe we can have that. Whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light. Mm-hmm. And then infrared bulbs. Mm-hmm. This is when it is dark. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And there should be a battery for power supply, and a chip, chip which is a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations, and wires connecting all chips, which lights, everything, so there should be wires. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and, different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape. To keep the remote? Yeah. Yeah. Case. A case holder. Holder. A holder remote holder. Holder, mm-hmm. Can you move onto the next slide. Next slide please. I have referred the homepage of our website, from where I got few points. Mm-hmm. That's it, that's it from me now. Okay. So we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there? Um. Or Okay. You don't have to. It's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that. If you want. Okay, thank you. It's okay. Could you go back to that slide where she had that slide up Betsy? It's actually now, there on the screen. This one? Okay, thank you. And Francine? Participant two. You are number two? Yes. No no, I'm three. You're three. I can make it full? Would you want it full full screen? Yes yes yes. Mm-hmm? Okay. Okay. As User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. Mm-hmm. Can you please go onto the next slide? Mm-hmm. So I found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at remote distance. Now for that, a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the TV. Mm-hmm. There should be something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it. Mm-hmm. Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice. On the on on the remote. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. So if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time, and it will switch on at that particular time. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. So he can use that kind of properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel. Yes. By your child, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The and one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV television. And this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T in alphabet for more compactability. Mm-hmm. And and it is one more point which I noted it down, like the material which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some allergy to either children or to adult person. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, 'kay. Mm-hmm. And it can have an alarm clock a person if somebody wants to get up at around eight PM then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock, and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm-hmm. If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock. And an alarm clock, that should be okay. Yes, and as John Reece said we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote, he should not be harmed in any way. Hmm. And findings, I found out on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used, there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities, there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are So you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not, no it can be used as a TV control plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock, and then to save electricity there should not be much move lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten at ten o'clock automatically, so that nobody else comes later and use it. Okay, it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television. Timer, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Timer. And then you can use a timer as well. Yes. That's it. Okay, now On my slide show basically we have already done the agenda, and on the closing basically there will be lunch break and all that. However the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. Okay. And what function, working design, how does it work. So these are the two things we should come up with. So the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a TV. Mm, TV. TV television we was. And I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV. Don't TV. There are a few but in general not. Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, I think that's one group that's certainly important. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear. Yeah. And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. That's a question whether that's important that children can really use it or not. Mm. So these are just some thoughts I have on it, and dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. There's the old motto, children under six never shop alone. Mm-hmm. So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull. That has a lot of appeal but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups. Mm. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. Mm-hmm. That's right. Yeah. Different colours. You make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana colour or whatever for example. Yes. You can make a banana shaped one. Yeah. Mm. But the question is really, who is our target group. Mm-hmm. Do we look at one target group? And with the twenty five Euros can we afford to have I'm asking the technical people here to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect? Respect. Mm. Okay. No generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people who have nervous problems, yes. Right. With Mm-hmm. We can design different remotes for different people, for aged people there will be big buttons and. That's. But in a family in a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes. Yeah. Children and everybody. They would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three Cost effective. Of course that we can do, but specifically if elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big remote controller for elderly and for children, in a different. What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much, is it? No, it doesn't cost. That that won't change much, will it? No The the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function, and I think how will it function is probably the question of the buttons within the target group or subgroups. Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter. I I wouldn't think so. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. Yeah. The basic design I understand will be the same, but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So that remains to be seen but the target group as a whole is basically everybody with a TV. That's right, and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? Yes. That's the question. The same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case. And in that case we could moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it? You as an industrial person? No. Mm, I I don't think no. Maybe there's an idea the for example new portable phones? It's not. Mm-hmm. They have removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, and maybe something like that, that in each package you you have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe that already comes in a package. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. There's a real idea. Mm-hmm. Hmm. And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately. Yeah. Right. For mobile phones we have different covers, like designs and all so that we can have that. Yes. Yes. Mm-hmm. That's right, but if then everybody is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package, then they can go to the store and for a few Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it for example. Yeah. An alternate package. Yeah. Okay. But I have a doubt will it be cost wise effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people. I think the idea here is to to design one remote and what the only change is gonna be the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way, having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children Five minutes I guess that's the old message. But. I think we can only. Okay. Cosmetic. Of okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Warning, finish meeting now. Finish meeting now. We may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but Mm-hmm. Maybe. But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If we do some more research, maybe we. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Okay, mm-hmm. I think maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent it's sort of like. Okay but we have to Okay, fair enough. Do we agree, do we? Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. Of course. Yes. Okay? Mm-hmm. So now I understand it's lunch break. And. So that's what we will do. Okay. Okay. So hank you very much. Thank you. And we'll see you after lunch.",
