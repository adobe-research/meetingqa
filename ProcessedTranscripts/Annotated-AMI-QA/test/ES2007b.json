I thought we all were. I have one too, okay. Okay. Whoops I forgot to put the thing on Okay. Yep. Right. I just wanna 'cause basically I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again. Okay I'm Okay. Just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll. Yeah. Sure, that's a good idea. Okay, and Gabriel. I'm Catherine with a C. CATH ER INE. Gabriel. EL is it? EL. Kay. And you're REISS Okay. I am Reissa. REISSA. Double S A. Sorry. S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think. Right. True. Right. Mm 'kay. Okay, right, welcome to meeting B. This is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting, basically, 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now. I am your Project Manager, and, I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going, get people talking and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically. Right, for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you, what you've been working on for the last wee while, when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and filling out silly questionnaires and things. But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive. So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a a little presentation. Mm. Um. Then we're gonna work, from each of your presentations. We'll talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all. And then we'll, sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it. How long is the meeting? This meeting it's not very long. It's probably down to about thirty five minutes now. Okay. So I want each of your presentations to not be too long, five five minutes, something like that. No problem. If you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy, it doesn't matter, it just it just says that it's that's just one particular medium. If you haven't had time to prepare one, you can draw stuff on the noteboard, you can talk to us, however you want to do your little presentation, basically, you can. Don't feel pressurised into using this thing. Cause I don't. Okay. So. You okay over there? Reissa, are you joining in with this meeting here or are or are you just are you just doing some Internet shopping there? I'm fine. Yeah. I. Think she's finishing up her presentation. I'm finishing off my presentation. No no. I'm done. Okay. Okay, jolly good. Alright, we all know that it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with. I think the first thing we should look at is probably what it is that it is actually supposed to be. Mm. So that's gonna be you Catherine, if we wanna hear from you first. Okay. Okay. Just connecting this. Are we getting Really? You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go. Okay. Cool. Okay. So I've got a very quick. Okay. So the working design, I've got a very quick presentation on this, so no, you can't see a thing. I'm gonna draw it on the board then. It's in blue and I couldn't change it. Oh. It's fine on my screen, but never mind. Ah. So the idea is that we've got the energy source which in our case will, okay, never mind. So I think maybe two batteries, dunno what they're called six, or something like that. Mm-hmm. And then then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal, which could be an infra-red signal, which will be sent by an electronic chip. And the chip will be controlled by the user interface. So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel. Mm-hmm. And the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels. And that's it really for the working design. Great. Okay. Sorry the presentation wasn't very clear but Really? I prefer the I prefer the human touch personally. Cool. Yeah. Should I erase this or Okay. Do you wanna just give us a moment, I just wanna copy this down. I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this? Fine. Or suggestions? Is a battery the only way of No, no No meant No 'cause always changing batteries can get annoying. It's just, you don't want it plugged in really, indoors. Alternate energy source, like wind power or Bicycle power. You blow on it and it's worked for the last fifty years. The battery's down and maybe, dunno, solar charged? I dunno, I I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain, but. Mm. Yeah. One question I have, and don't how much control have over this is as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the TV, and still have it be operational? Maybe we want one with a strong signal stream. How far away is your television? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you unless you've got a TV the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, does it? That's true. The thing is you don't we can make the signal strong enough to go through walls if you fancy it. Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall. But if you're on the phone in the other room and you turn television off or something and you don't really want to put the telephone down, and go into the other room. I didn't think about that but Why not? How about Bluetooth? Instead of using infra-red, use Bluetooth. Isn't that a better signal? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it. It sounds like you don't wanna overcomplicate things. Mm. We don't need it. It's quite nice, but then I dunno, either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room, you are gonna But we can keep the idea if We can see at a later stage, maybe, I don't Do you need the border? Exactly. Basically, we're we're we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit. We're not designing something that you can plug in a headset to and connect to your laptop computer and stuff. It's Okay. Mm. S just an idea. Right, done, Catherine. Gabriel let's hear from you on on such things. Okay. I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint. Okay. Sorry. Technical. Okay. Adjusting. Okay, so, while this is warming up, there it is. Yeah. So I'm doing the user interface design. Mm-hmm. And basically as far as methods, I was looking at looking at already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there. Thinking of what we can retain, what we can do away with, what we can perfect a little bit as far as design. We don't want to do something that's too radical of a change, guess, people want a remote that's familiar, that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics, so we can improve what's out there and maintain the basic functionality that people want. Mm. So things that seem like absolute must-haves would be a volume control, so up-down keys for that, channel keys up-down, but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want, rather than doing up-down, and a mute button. One thing that I didn't include here, that I forgot that we talked about last time, was doing some sort of lock function. I dunno, that's one possibility. Okay. And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes, ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred, which I don't know if I can access the web page from here, but I can show you. Yeah. So this is a engineer centred one, so see it's rather busy, but it also lets you stop your movie, fast-forward, all this, freeze frame. Mm-hmm. And this is a user centred one. It's easier to just glance at this and see what's possible to do, you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes. Yeah. Great. And judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, or the direction we were going in at least. Um. So, the engineering centred ones provide a lot of functionality, but it can be a little bit overwhelming, so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use. And this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person Reissa, because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this. Mm. Yeah. So that's me. Great. Okay. Now I just have a question for you. This research that you've been doing looking at other, existing units stuff. Have you found that anyone else has looked into the locking function or. No that that seemed like a novel idea as far as I know. Obviously another exists like you said in mobile phones. That was sort of the inspiration for it. I've never seen that in in all my years in the remote business. Yeah. I've, haven't I've never seen a locking functionality. I dunno, do you guys have a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? I would say If it's simple to do, which I think it probably should be, even if it's a a a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote, even something like that, then yes, it's like, you said earlier on a flip thing, something like that, but being physical. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Kay. Right. Look into. I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta look like it's in the R and R. Mm. The company it's from what I can see from our other products, are yellow with blue writing on them. Right. Mm. Um. And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics. We put the fashion in electronics. Mm. I think I think we have to carry that mental. There you go. So it's gotta look new and something fashionable. If remote control if telephones can be fashionable, then maybe remote control units can be. Mm. Mm. I think, we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is sort of like the ergonomic design. Yeah. Because we need. I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here. Everything is going ergonomic, there's mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches sort of in the market, I guess. Great. Okay, fantastic. Um. Right, done, Gabriel. Okay. Reissa. Where does it go into? Let's plug you in, baby. Here? Yeah. The blue thing. This is getting all. Mm. Then you just have to do function F eight and it should come up. Function F eight. No. It just takes a wee while. It just takes a second. Come on. Right. Okay. Okay. For our marketing report we observed remote control users in a usability lab, and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out. Total number of people tested were a hundred just so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings. So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly. Okay, so they don't like the look of the remote control. Eighty eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the remote control looked really cool and fancy. So I think we all agree with that. Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user. So, the way they operate it doesn't match how people behave. Per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote, so probably if you have one, two, three, four, five, the whole up to ten, they only use the up and down channel. Cause we've only got five channels. Exactly. That's another thing. Seventy five per cent of users say they zap. Not quite sure what they mean, zap, goes like. I think that's flicking quickly between channels. You wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote. I think especially for the older generation. I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones, takes ages to work how to use. Anyway and they also remotes often get lost in the room, so nobody can find them. Mm. So maybe tracking devices is a good idea. Personal preferences. Wow. You are a child of technology, aren't you? So I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people. Has to look really cool, flashy groovy for people to buy it. And it's easy to find, so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating. So voice activation. So and this was what we came up with. Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age, sorry, age groups. So fifteen to twenty five said ninety one per cent of them said yes. So there you go. So basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one. And neither did the older generation, but the younger generation who we are catering for, who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice speech recognition in a remote. But do the younger generation have the money? No I would say the older people. They they don't. It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty there's a big drop off there. The twenty five to thirty five year old, and thirty five, and the thirty five to forty five, forty five point seven per cent say no, so These guys are growing up. For people up to the age of thirty five, you're kinda saying, they want it. But no most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years. That would be my guess as well. And that's quite a minority there, so fifty fifty that's thirty five per cent. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? If it's twelve fifty per unit. Yeah. Okay, there's. Voice activation might not be the best. I would say I'd say scrap that straight off. Also with buttons, a thing called RSI, so wrist sense? Repetitive strain injury or from doing Mm. Repetitive strains injury, so they don't I think people who watch TV maybe too often, keep changing channel hurts their wrist. I don't think so. Maybe they shouldn't watch so much TV then. So it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then when designing the ergonomics of there's any medical background we can find out about this. Maybe not so hard. Mm. Maybe instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep. Yeah. Let's we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time, say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury. Maybe Mm. We should probably consult with our legal department. Yeah. They're having a lunch break at the moment, but. Yeah. I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting. Yeah. I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements. Yeah. Mm. Maybe the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much, or we just flat buttons, something. Mm. Yeah. Okay. So that is me. That's great, thank you very much for that, Reissa. Okay, so basically we've we've we've decided that we're going for a basic television remote. It's gotta be safe to use, it's gotta look cool. Mm. It's gotta be cheap. Um. Mm. Now going back to the industrial design of it, we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth. I think, we should just go with the simplest option on everything, and that would be infra-red, energy source, that would be batteries. Mean we can look into using the, little tiny weeny batteries, all special long-lasting batteries. Um. But there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years, because technology will have changed and, we won't have televisions in ten years' time. So I think we're all pretty sussed on that. Anyone have any questions? Mm. Everybody happy in their work? It seems like we're all pretty much on the same page. Now we've got a good structure going on. We all know where we're going to. Have you been has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers? It's probably just you, 'cause you're the project manager. Just questionnaires. Yeah. Sell trying to sell your things. Stuff. Okay. Have you guys found out if we can e-mail stuff to each other? You can. Right. Okay. Do all you all know my e-mail address? No I don't. I think he's participant one, aren't you? In the project announcement, you've got the addresses, I think. It's just participant one okay. So Project Manager, it's participant one at AMI. Yeah. Can you all e-mail me your e-mail addresses? It's just it's just one, participant two. You have them you have them, but we'll send you an e-mail. Send me, okay. You want to have friends, don't you? Are we headed towards a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that. Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, but I might be just going a bit Okay. It's white on white and blue on a black background with yellow borders. Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves. Maybe you can come up with a couple of different ideas? It could come But it could come in different colours and have the RR colours just somewhere just around the lock button could be the RR logo or colours and If. Mm. Can't we have different colours in the remotes, so somebody can choose different does it have to be of a certain? See the thing is we've gotta keep the company image. Mm. It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction product. But if it's a RR, it would be Real Reaction, if it had a symbol on it. Mm. There's loads of companies that called RR. Mm. Whoa. This is but this is the slogan, this is the the the the type. And this is something that came on down from the higher ups, so, we are sort of beholden to them. Yeah. So we have to have it one colour. Not necessarily. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. But we have to incorporate it. Mm. Not necessarily even if it just has to but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a, Panasonic product. Mm. It's got to so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a similar vein, perhaps. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Quite. This is all your department. Mm okay. Done everybody. And I think we stop for lunch now. Pretty soon I guess that's now. Are we are we finished ahead of schedule? We might possibly have done. Cool. Alright, see you all soon. If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish, then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch. Kay. There you go. Right. I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down, but Take your headsets off, kick back, smoke 'em if you got 'em.",
