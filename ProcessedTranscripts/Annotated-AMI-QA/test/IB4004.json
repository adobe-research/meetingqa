    "displayText": "Hey look, these are microphones they're for women's shirts. No no it's the opposite. Okay, so let's start. Thanks for coming again to this meeting. I hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some progress this on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms. I hope you had fun in designing something or asking the people about their preferences and things like this. So that's what I was talking about, it's for women's shirts. So I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings, I think, you'll be more and more used to it as soon as we move. So we have these one person, two person and three person rooms. And so that makes, eighteen places. And we had about fifteen people and some spare mm working places to put may I first provide the answers to the questions from the last time? And I also checked with Maggie and Pierrette. Great. So that will be part of your your solution or suggestions to solution. But regarding the constraints there is no immediate plan to make separations between the rooms so that means basically we have to do with this setting and it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls, so I think we shouldn't count on them in the next four years maybe. And they don't want to provide an extra working space for Gisella with the other IT admins, which we could understand, because it's sort of full over there, but at least that's what they said. Great. Come now, it's not full over there. So it seems the we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us. Though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe, but we'll see. So regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the three person rooms, it's not very easy, we'll have to play quite wisely with the furnishing. It looks like it's not impossible, at least on the one that is a bit longer, on the right. So the one here. It should be possible to put four persons. If we could avoid it, it would much simplify things, but we'll see. The the question is is it is it against the regulation security regulation of the school. No. No no. That's that's the important point. No no no. And and I and I went over and I looked at that room, too. There's plenty of space for four people. Okay. I think. It's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture, since we are experts at this task okay, so maybe we could count on four places, but the final decision is not really ours, so we'll see actually this Exactly. Yeah. That would be fine if one of the person is fifty per cent. So me, for example. Or one of the intern positions, the people who might come or something like that. Ah. Exactly. Yeah. Okay so these were the answers. So actually I did my proposal as a slide. Would you like me to start or would you like me to end? Mm. Just to complete I talked both with Maggie and Pierrette and both of them are happy to share offices. Please. It's great. They have no problem whatsoever. They're easy, but could be as Pierrette has right now, that she is happy to continue to share with Marianne, and Maggie, for example, to share with it could be with Bruno, because they work on the SwissTra together and they like to gossip together, so. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Beautiful. Yes. That looks good. Okay, then let me explain very briefly the rationale for this. So it's the same schema that. In red you have the excuse me, that's quite annoying, excuse me. Hello. Can I call you a bit later in about half an hour. That's. People who don't turn off their phone in a meeting. I'm just in the middle of a meeting and I'm talking. It's fantastic. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Let me check that I I I didn't. Sorry for this. But putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge. Fortunately we were just the four of us. Um. Okay, so, let me get back into the proposal after the brief interruption. So the names are in red. Now one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more or less group people within projects, because I think that sometimes they just discuss together and it's easier if they are in the same office. Which is quite happy actually, I also thought that some professors might enjoy, or at least don't say anything about, being with their assistants. So I was happy to hear Susan saying that Maggie and Bruno could together, and Pierrette and Marianne in the same office. Yeah. So what I can say is that I also understood that Susan would be rather in favour of having her own office, so it's it's working like this. Yes. I put the lounge in the middle. It's also one of the rooms with the fewest windows. So I think that's not a problem, because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside. But it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office, I guess. I don't know. Maybe, I thought in an angle, but that's obviously not very. It's a question of you are printing all the time so that's a possible. No. Why not put the printer out in the hallway? Okay and so next to the photocopy maybe it wouldn't be a bad place. Yeah. Here? Why not? It is there enough space there for a photocopy and printer. Okay. We'll have to check but the printer is quite small if we find just a small table for it. The photocopy is a bit big. Maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer. Okay, but okay, so the printer, we'll remove it if we work from this solution. So IMtwo is more or less in the upper left side. I said more or less lower left side you have SwissTra and, so the two projects from the list. And then on the on the right side. Maybe not a a very good solution for Gisella. If you can suggest something better, because she's with two people who two PHD students, and it's true that she has, a lot of phone calls to make, but it's some way to solve some constraints. I think this is a very open thing. If you want we can use this document or we could just, say, first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one. I've a question. What's the justification for giving Nancy her own office? Maybe not a very strong one. Then they maybe you are you have better suggestions. It was sort of one of the places that remain and I think, there is no strong constraint and she's a smoker, but the policy is that we don't smoke, so it's even better if she's with a second person. Mm doesn't help. I would have a provocative suggestion to switch Nancy and Gisella. Uh-huh. Put Gisella, the fax, and the printing machine the printer in the one person room as a Okay, so the printer that's not the hard constraint 'Cause I really do think it's important to have an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room, where you have files, where you can close it, you have the personal files of the people of the of the unit etcetera, etcetera. Okay. Uh-huh. Gisella will not be very happy about that. We tried that and Gisella really didn't like to have a printer and people in and out all the time and remember Andrei, that was. Mm-hmm. Mm. That was the case and she was a bit reluctant, but Mm-hmm. We could store files there and things like that. Mm-hmm. Okay, so if you want I can already do this change here. So for instance I be fully against the fact that my personal files are in in a in a room that is not specifically dedicated for that. Because the professors you have personal printer or there is only one printer? Sorry you're. Because if not the person the printer can go in a room of three people. That's typical of case where there's the lab and there's the printer is there. Mm-hmm. Printer can be in the in the in the corridor. When the printer is, it's the main one. That's that's perfectly alright. We have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room, but it's basically, the the printer where everybody prints. So I change this. So maybe I would suggest let me can I hear also let us hear from you. And then if we can work out a a common solution from this one, then we go back to to this slide. And if not, we'll just, well start from scratch. I'm perfectly alright to share the room with you has a view on the old town. Um. You have to be aware of what I was saying last time was that you have to suffer from phone calls. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Lot's of phone calls. Yeah. I'll try. I'll bring my walkman and. So if you have a walkman that's that's good. Earplugs whatever. David, you had also what's Ah. Okay, for me as don't the people a lot, you suggested that there's a lack of men so, I would certainly put not two men in the same office. I would try to share them with the women so for example in your slide I could switch either you or Martin with the other room. This one. Uh-huh. Let me put the plan, sorry. So. I will display this is the empty one. Yes please. I don't want to influence you. So you would put. So, you have to show us which one you were talking about David, we didn't Ah the centre room. I was wanting to change this Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You can you can even stand and just show us there. But I need your slide, because I was talking about your slide. Okay, so we would prefer the names. Okay I don't want to influence you too much, but mm I'm perfectly happy to start with this as the basis and then change things. Because there are plenty of things that are okay but for Pierrette and Maggie it's. Yes, so here you can see that the the men is they are always sharing the room with a woman. Maybe in different, just Uh-huh. Pierrette and Nikos is a guy also. Mm-hmm. It's because I didn't get your solution. Or actually, Pierrette is a woman too. Oh. It's the feminine of Pierre. Sorry for this. Mm-hmm. So this is perfectly fine, I will just send Martin and Andrei for Maria or Yalina or Nancy, maybe. So here there are two men. What was it again? So? So I. He wants to mix sexes. Uh-huh. I it's nice. Ah, okay. I don't think there's a lack of men here, in in this in this lab. Bad. So I would change one, switch one. Yeah. But men or women, it's more the question of, as I said, that's here you have PHD students that are a group. There you have senior researchers that are a group, which is to me more Unless it corresponds to some specific demand like it is in the case in Maggie Maggie's case and Pierrette's case. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think that's a very efficient way of doing things, because mm I'm perfectly happy with Andrei so. Mm-hmm. And for me I would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office, just to be a bit calmer, and, Martin, so I'm very happy with you since I proposed it. But I could also be happy with most of the other people, so even in a three person room. Sure but isn't there just a a question of proximity you put David with Agnes? It's it's fine. Okay, so let's keep in mind, maybe, this constraint of balancing the genders we'll see if we can do something for it. Andrei did you ask these people if this was okay with them? I've asked some of them, and I've also used a little bit the present arrangement, just not to shock people too much. And it's also people that I know get on quite quite well together, and also work on the same project, for instance, the Finnish Marianne, and Nikos who interact quite a lot on. Maria and Yalina seem to go on one quite quite well. Nancy had no strong preference, specially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in her office. So I think, at least as far as I asked there was no major objection. But isn't Agnes working in a more substantial way with people like either Maria or Yalina? Um. That's true. Yes. That's true. So we could put Nancy with David and put Agnes. Cause I know. But Agnes is also working with David, but there's but that's not important. But we agree that it's not important to to share the room with someone that has the same project. Mm-hmm. No, that's true. The other constraints are are satisfied somehow so. Mm-hmm. Quite happy to have the the full room some fifty per cent of the time. That's a small advantage and it's a bit more more comfortable, actually. Um. No but what it was was the three person rooms, that they can mix them the way they want. If they prefer to be Maria Yalina and Nikos, and Nancy and Marianne on the other side no that's not completely equivalent, because Nancy all are PHD students or masters students, but Nancy. Correct? Mm-hmm. Oh. One question I was wondering about though, 'cause the more people in a office the less ideal, that wouldn't it maybe be better to put David in, since he's only half-time. Maybe. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that way, then there's not three people all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I would switch David and Nancy typically. Mm-hmm. Probably Mm-hmm. Which doesn't mean that David should be in this room. He could be in the other one. For me the two three people rooms are really they have to be re-shuffled according to personal preferences. Yeah. Yeah. So Agnes has worked Mm-hmm. But I definitely would put Nancy with Agnes in the two person room. They they have worked together on, so this makes some sense. Yeah. As far as I know I think it's probably quite a good match. But again, it's also a question of personal preference. You can't be in a room with person you don't want to be with. Is there anyone that is going to finish PHD or or leave or. No. Maria is the closest, but she's still not. First one should be Maria, but it's still one and a half. Okay, let's switch Mm-hmm. I see if you do it this way, you mean that in the two three people room there will be one that is not so overloaded, because of David, because David will be part time and the other one not so overloaded, because there is knowing that this one free position will not stay free very long. No, because don't forget we already have somebody coming in January. Yes And this is still a worry for me, because we still don't have enough space for the visitors. Mm-hmm. At least one person. I'll just. Unless we put them in the lounge. Mm I don't think okay since we are supposed to do a final proposal. Yeah. Therefore I. Or we make four space in the three people rooom. Yeah. We need to have at least three visitors' position, because positions, because Outside. Sorry, let me move the printer next to the photocopier. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And we'll find some way to attach it to a wall or something like this. So that we keep it, you mean. I think so. Okay, so that's the mm-hmm. I don't think we can put visitors in the lounge, it's. It depends it depends on how we think about the lounge. If it's thought as being a reading room. No. If it's thought as the that that's really a very important question to me. Yeah. Do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our offices or in our work place? We can read newspapers elsewhere. Mm-hmm. And I really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers. Newspapers you can read them home. Know we can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else. Yeah. You can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer. So I I don't understand why we why we should put priority on lounges if we if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors. It's Mm-hmm. That's just not not according to my priorities. How how would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices? In, one of the one person offices? I know they are actually quite demanded, so I think, Susan, you are very happy with this solution, so okay. Yes, yes. So let's put the lounge in Susan's office, and Susan's in Susan in the lounge with three visitors mm? It's probably too small. That's an excellent idea. No, but a lounge in a one person room is really too small. It's too small for a. Okay, doesn't work. Mm. I would advocate to just remove the lounge. We it's a luxury for us. We don't have space for a lounge. Mm-hmm. Let's be you cannot you cannot go at the at the at the in front of your colleagues and saying, if I have to choose between reading my newspaper and having a decently welcomed research visitor, I prefer to read my newspaper. Okay, let's be innovative. Um. That's just not that's just not realistic. Mm-hmm. We are researchers. But the problem is it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we need the lounge, so I think it's simply not No actually, I'm sorry, it's. No no, I don't think we can choose. But then? Then you have the three people room, split it in two parts Susan was proposing last time was a wall and you have a lounge there can read your newspapers and we have a full two person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors. Mm-hmm. And at least we have some free margin for the next two years, or the next year. Oh. Okay so how do we split the room? The the three people over there. We put it the the furniture that we got for our reading room, we put it into the other half of the three person room. This one. Uh-huh. Yeah. And put mm They are not supposed to have a discussion in the lounge, they are supposed to read their newspapers. Mm-hmm. Would that fit? So. A little divider of some kind. But what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge? And to drink their coffee. Not the newspapers, because no scientific articles. Not just newspapers. Scientific articles. No that wasn't the goal. Journals. The the goal of the lounge was was a place where you can relax. Uh-huh. But also to read articles. Yeah. You can do it in your office. So you would like to put it, within and then who. It's it's it's you have a good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break you heart your your your your back your office. Yeah. Okay, but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side, here. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. And here we'll put two places for visitors. Three. Three. But that means the office will be at least for the moment empty. That looks very bad. No, we have our visitor that is arriving. What did you say, Susan? It's not a visitor. It's a a new full-time person arriving in January. Okay. Okay, so that could take the free place over there. I think okay, so we need what, two, three positions and one new person arriving, X or something like that. No, that's where we're gonna put the lounge. No no. That could take one positions in the in the Ah okay, that's an idea. No. Let's put Maria or Yalina in the in the in this place. For No no no no, we have to. If if if if you forget about the lounge. Okay. Mm-hmm. What you could do is to move either Maria or Yalina in mm what is currently the lounge. Mm-hmm. That means that we have one person there with one free position. We have one free position in the in the room that Maria or Yalina is coming from and one free position over there. Mm-hmm. So we have three position distributed over the rooms where we can accommodate No lounge. And and where is the lounge? No lounge. No okay, no way. I'll I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge. Louge. You take the furniture of the lounge and you put it in the corridor. So No no no no, let's do the lounge corner. No, there's no space. The lounge is in the free space. Okay. At least. Otherwise I cannot really defend it, because it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every decision we made. After all that we went through to get the budget for it, we really have to No, wait a minute. I think so. You you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet, because there is a reading room where people have to relax. Okay. Let's have the visitors first. Okay, so what we need is a new and two. So I think we can put, what, Maria or Yalina? I don't want to separate them really, but. I don't like that office actually. So I was thinking to put here now. It could be Nikos, for instance. Could put you can switch. No, we are not gonna keep Marianne in a three person place just having Marianne in the lounge. But it's a lounge. Yeah. So either we could put the visitor with you, Martin, but it's probably okay, let's try this. But then you could put me there. Let's try Maria here. Andrei. You don't mind? Because I will be there half time, and the visitors probably will not so much complain about phone calls. Perfect. But wait a minute, then Andrei has a two person office all for himself. No no, we'll put a visitor place in there. If you don't mind. There is this full-time person arriving in I think it's really important to plan with that. Yeah. What's what's her name again, Andrei? I think it's Paola. Paola. Yeah. Um. Would it be possible to have Paola in your office? Could be. Cause that's that's something that we we should be deciding. If. Either you want to keep me in your office, which is alright, and then we have to forsee a place for Paola somewhere. Mm-hmm. No, I would prefer you, I think. I think that's not realistic to have a planning. Okay, let me keep you. Okay. Martin goes back to Andrei. Okay, we'll put Paola and a visitor here. So Paola is the new person. And a visitor, vis. That's visitor one. Is that vis one? And then we'll we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here. Vis two. Oops. Sorry, it's not very nice, but Does this display better? Mm. Paola being new, I think it would be better to put her with somebody else. I think it's not bad. Don't put her alone. Somebody else. Uh-huh. The lounge can not be in here with two people. You cannot go there and discuss and two people working there in the room. Yeah. Yeah. Not supposed to discuss, you are supposed to relax. No, but we said that we won't discuss or maybe if we organise some kind of, coffee at the end of the day, or a drink, then the two people will stop working. I don't know, maybe they won't be happy. Okay then, Martin let me put you in that office and I'll put Paola with me. Sure not me. No no put why not Maria or Yalina? No? So Martin goes where? Martin stays. Maria's. Yeah. Because you don't want to separate Maria and Yalina? Okay. Why? Cause Yalina, it's not even sure she stays. Okay. That's true. It's a master student so. Okay, so let's put Maria in the separate office. And we have, two visitors and a masters student and a part-time person. And we have Paola. I was thinking the other way around. Sorry, what were you thinking? To keep Paola with Maria in the two people room and to have this one with two, Yalina and David in the three people room. Who is with Maria here? Paola. Okay. Yeah. And no visitor? No, that's a two people room, so Yep. But that means that the middle one, would be quite empty. All the two visitors and the fifty per cent person, I don't think it's very reasonable. No, Yalina is there, David is there but you need to have to put visitors somewhere, Ah. We have. But let's split them a little bit, so that when there are no visitors, at least people are I think so. No, the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied. Oterwise, we might lose room or two. Oh. Okay. So this goes here goes visitor two. That's true. This is always the game. Paola is there. Here goes visitor one. And is this better? Except that we cannot read it, but apart from this Mm-hmm. It's a little bit crowded in. Cause not yet, of course, because Paola has not arrived, but starting from January, you will have two full-time person plus one part-time person plus one visitor that's 'Kay. Okay. Let me call this visitor one, which implies that it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come. Okay. And this visitor two which means it's a, second chance. But why couldn't we basically Move you, David, in this two people room with Maria? Or we could. What would this change? Maria plus one half half-time person? Mm-hmm. And you have Paola, Yalina, one visitor position, and I still hope that Marianne, Nikos that the lounge will on the, on the long term disappear, because anyhow I don't believe there can be a lounge in a place where there are already two people working. So the lounge will just die after some point and it Still. No, but look, Martin, it's quite a long room, it has two doors the occupancy is better that way. Ah okay, ah it has two doors. Very good. That's true. So maybe in the long run we'll get a wall. Ah but then okay okay. Okay, that's true. Kay then then there will be a wall. Uh-huh. Although there are three windows, but okay. Okay. That's good. So where would we move David to Maria with Maria. Do you have any preferences, David? Um. It's completely fine. She she wants mixing men and women, or he. He already is mixed. Right. So. Then the two visitors will be in one room, but doesn't that's fine, because maybe there are not two visitors at the same time. Yeah. To me it's more realistic. We'll see. I wouldn't put the two visitors in the same room, because when there is no one it makes a big hole, and when there are two people, so it makes too many variations, but. But then you can move for instance if you move David with Maria. Mm-hmm. Then I think it's it's better. You prefer that too, Susan? Because there is regular occupancy. First it's better. I think it's because it's stabler. Okay. Cause visitors stay and go. Okay. Oops. Sorry. What did we say here? This one. One. That's good. My Okay. To me that's the best we can do. If you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge. I think that was really decided and it's no we no, because, actually if we do a proposal without a lounge, and, the other group will exactly, and that means that all the constraints that we said and all the other things just, just basically disappear. Okay okay okay. We won't be very credible. I I got the message. Yes, sir. Uh-huh, which means we've worked for nothing. Okay. What's wrong with this? So who has strong strong opposition to that? Okay. I don't. You have to go, Susan? I'll be right back. Okay. But do you have any no. We are almost done, Susan, but we'll we'll just check the items. I I just need to see somebody. Please. Okay. But it's just a decision. No problem. No, you just have. We'll just review the items to see is we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final yes or no. Okay. Um. I think we we we accommodated most of the constraints. Yeah. Cause we are sure that Maggie is happy with having Bruno in her office and Pierrette is happy to have Marianne in her office. Mm-hmm. I think that's okay. That's that that checked? Okay. We checked. And, yes, and no reason to think that there should be an impossible situation? Uh. I don't think so. No. Same thing for Marianne and Marianne F and Nikos? Mm-hmm. Paola we don't know yet, because she didn't arrived yet. And Aha, that means for a short time Yalina will be just alone in the three person room. That's a bit that was the point in letting David there but okay, maybe we'll just leave it as an option. That's a bit a problem. David or visitor one or two. Ah but then what we could just for the sake of having a defendable solution, as long as Paola has not arrived, is to switch for the proposal Paola and David But we really plan that as soon as Paola is here or even earlier David will go to the two people room. It's Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. So we'll know that the region actually around here is probably movable. It's just it will be switched. Either, we can switch Maria or Paola or David. Cause this this this this is dangerous to propose. Yeah. You have a three person room with one masters student in it. Mm-hmm. Okay? No, exactly. That's why I always try to separate the visitors, just to balance a little bit. So I wouldn't I wouldn't propose that. Okay. But okay, we'll be open on that point. But as soon as Paola is here, it starts to be better. It will become Mm-hmm. And we will have visitors, for sure. Or it depends also on if Yalina stays longer or not, which is not yet very clear, but Okay, we'll see. Right right, that's true. Yeah. That's a point, true. Ah do do we know do we know when is she supposed to finish her master thesis? Anyway, we'll we'll be open. Mm don't really I think her master thesis is probably due no, I would say, maybe June next year? In June? June next year. At the latest. Yeah. Actually I don't know, unfortunately. Okay, when do you when when are we supposed to sumbit the proposal? We won't have any extra meeting, the four of us, so, this one has to be the final one. Kay, that's now. Okay. So we'll have actually I'll present this to, with the other, I'll compare it with the other one, and try to make a decision actually. Mm. I think it's even a bit later, or in two days, or something like this. Okay. So as soon as we have Susan we can so I would switch again. Again, okay. But as I say, it's just for the sake of the proposition, so I'm even ready to internally say that David will actually be in this room. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We can leave it like this and then there will be names on the doors. What does it what does it change? Names on the doors? Aha, so if we 'cause, Susan, the the the problem let's say not the technical, the psychological problem we have is I'm extremenly happy with that solution. Sorry. It would be a working solution starting from January, when Paola will be here. But currently if we present it as it is, we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student. No, because there is another person right now, a student that I just hired. And she's just working right now for November and December. Aha, so you have a student. So she'll be a visitor. That we that's a real visitor to some extent. She's a she's a real visitor. She's a real visitor that I just made a contract for her for two months. Ah, so this one and this two one are just ah okay, okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So then we would have two people there. Okay. Okay. We'll keep it like this. Then that works. Okay I'll try to express all these constraints and say in particular that things could be changed over there, but on some other sides the visitor space, I'll Mm-hmm. But you really have also to say that that a unit has to have some horizon. It's it's it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us. That's true. The second point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it, you should mm circulate it over mail to all the involved people. And I'm not very sure, but I think this will be done after the meeting, when okay. To double-check so that I would do it before. Cause if you spend time defending a thing then don't Agnes comes to you or Pierrette comes to you saying it, no I don't want to be with Marianne. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. What do you do? As far as know I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay, I'll circulate this. So it's just people will look at it, say great, I have a view on the mountain and I'm with a person I like, so I'm happy. Perfect. Exactly. Okay, so maybe we'll learn some more constraints. Okay. What's the timeline on this now? So you have a meeting when? Actually as I told Martin this is the last time we meet, so this is, more or less our proposal, and we'll have a meeting, I think, it's in two days or something like that. To discuss and compare with the other proposal and make a final decision. Because it's it's not it's not completely it's an important issue, because I need to know, when I will have the office decided, the phone number decided. Actually, probably a pre-final one, since we'll have to check again with everyone. But Mm-hmm. Because these are information that I have to provide to administration. Mm-hmm. I'm reachable when I'm at they can phone me on the mobile, but I would definitely prefer to have a clean filled administrative form that I can give back. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So actually I think, I'm not very sure, but the most important thing is, finding out when we will move and this happens in probably, next month or depends also on how, well, the furnishing goes on. Yes, yes. Okay. And then of course you have all these practical issues, how about internet connections? Network connections? No. How many connections are there per room? Because that's also something double check. Um. If you are in a room with three people and one network connection no no. No no no. No the the the building is very no actually I've seen it. The building is very modern and actually we'll get them activated. Okay. But are they activated? Okay. And I think you get at least three per room. Okay. Or probably more than that. No, for the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines. Okay. You need, because sometimes you need a laptop and So you agree with a lounge? Okay. Ah okay. Good that looks good. Yeah. Sometimes he needs two computers. Yeah. No, because they have a Sun and they have a PC, so we have to say how many places that we want to have. No this. And if you go back to the other slide where you have the furniture so with this we have any any word to say so that I would like to have a red chair or a blue desk or a So that's the standard things. Hmm. No, unfortunately that's decided by the school, so the chairs are blue, the desk is well, light-brown. But do we have to order something or is it done automatically, so it will be in the office when we move in? And normally it's done automatically, except that we'll have to think these are dictated by the names. It's probably more difficult for the lounge. What we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring it's not old, because we just bought it, but all the furniture from the previous lounge we'll bring it here. Mm-hmm. Mm. And how about the boxes, because you have to say when you will be moving the boxes, so that you have people for moving them. Uh. Or here you're supposed to move them yourself, or So we'll receive some information about that? I think it's a completely different issue from arranging people. They'll just give us a date when there is downstairs in the building and pretty soon the whole building will be covered. Okay. It's just how the moving will take place. That's true, but right, right, right. And there are things to take care of, but it's quite unrelated with these things. Okay, okay. We'll get all the information. Thinking about internet connections, I think it's quite okay the for the printer to be there. That's an important point, the printer needs to be connected. I think it's feasible. We'll we'll check. So the violet box here is our mailboxes also. By the way is there any wireless connection antennas for getting 'cause I've I've heard that there is one downstairs in that But that's important. Not at the sixth floor. Not in the building for the moment. Not at this Mm-hmm. Yeah. Typically for the laptops it's Ah okay, good. But right now in downstairs it's fine. Some people can pick it up on sixth floor. But pretty soon the whole building will be covered. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think it's a bit off topic already. Okay. So let's say that it's a proposal. I'm, I'll try to express the constraints and your opinions and I think, finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem, but I think with this we don't run into huge problems. Mm? Sure. At least the four of us will not veto. Obviously. At least. So let me save this. And thank you for spending all this time. Yeah. Hope you're all happy. Okay.",
