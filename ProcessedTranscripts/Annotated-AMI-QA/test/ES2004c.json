    "displayText": "I'll wait until you're all hooked up. Good grief. Kay. Okay. Oh. Put it on in that way. Oops. Thanks. Okay. Mm. Welcome back everybody, hope you've had fun. After lunch. Yeah. Right this is our conceptual design meeting, I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting, I I think. Mm-hmm. I was getting that impression as well. Mm-hmm. Mm. This is where we talk about properties, materials, user-interface and trend-watching. Etcetera. Mm-hmm. So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already, but we'll just go over it. The minutes from the last time. We had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. Leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost, things like that, and our market was going to be young, business, kind of range. Yeah. Yeah. Kay. Okay, shall we start with the first presentation? Shall I? Yep. Yes if you feel It's okay. Okay. We just connect up. Thank you. There we go. Okay so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. The methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is. We decided on the most important aspect required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. So the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at. Yeah. Okay, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan. Be interesting to see what our design people make of that. Kay. Okay thank you very much. Let's start from the inside and work our way out. Yep. Fine. Okay. It's okay with me. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Not yet? I don't think so, not yet. Kay. Yes, thank you. That screwed in? Okay. I hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them. Yeah. I know. Kay, Okay. Okay. This is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay, first Into the method. The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials, 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately aren't available. Kay. Findings, I've got my nice little picture there. This is the chip called the TA double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and it's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment. Kay. And then we're looking into battery options. There's actually no rechargeable option available, so I saw the standard double A and triple A which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be honest, it's it's basically like wind-up radio. Can you explain that? A right, okay. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. What kind of how long can you get out of that, can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? I you wouldn't have to wind it for very long, but I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you think of the next two options, like the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light in the room anyway so they could get when you got TV. Or That doesn't count though does it? Does does light charge as as sunlight does? I thought it was UV like Any, any I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Artificial light? No. Is it? Alright the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up. Has to be solar. Yep. Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space. Okay. Mm. I don't think it counts electric lights no, but not many you don't want to limit your market. Artificial light, no. That's going to I know, different parts of the world too, if we're if we're marketing internationally. People who live in basement flats there's not that many people, but there are people. Right. And most people also watch TV in the night anyway. Night. Mm, but then I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. Okay. The kinetic charging which is you get it in wrist watches and you don't even notice it. I've seen But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist so it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around, you're doing things, it is moving a lot of the time. The amount of probably moving. And are these what are the life of the kinetic battery, it runs for long time? It charges into some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and the size sort of a watch battery, 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches. Mm-hmm. Okay. And that would last for I I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out. We Solar would be slightly expensives. Yeah. But then again I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount it's it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side. If you switch the TV on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side. Mm-hmm. Is it really gonna be enough? Okay. And for the same reason, you're only using it for a incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no I don't think the draw on it would be Mm. Hmm. So it's not the draw on it isn't Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Could I just ask referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries? Could people put standard batteries in but they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible? I think you could have a dual power thing but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case because, if you lie on a calculator they're they're quite big and they all look identical. A dual kind of. Mm. So that affects the exterior design. Expensive as well. They're expensive, the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones, but It's I think they're not very resistant to dropping, 'cause if you drop stuff if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so. What kind of price are we looking at for presume the normal batteries are the cheapest? Another question is sorry. Solar. They're not designed Practical-wise okay. I think practically. Calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes they can they do, they they've got dual things, but the batteries are smaller I think. You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well? Mm. Mm. Again it Mm. Which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be charging a mobile phone every day. Mm. A remote control, so we have to look at the life also. So the the if you had something using the standard batteries and the solar charging, I think it would how long the standard double As would last in or triple As would last. It would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature, it's not gonna add anything, okay. I think it would. Okay, can we add in an attachment to closing feature? Okay. Can we think about that? Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's add it in to think about because, where am I? Yeah. Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I personally right, okay. If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you wouldn't lose it so much. Yeah. Yeah. But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls. Yeah. Focus groups and market research, it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field. No. Okay. So Mm-hmm. Okay. But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. Okay, right. Okay, I'll move on. Mm-hmm. My second part of my findings the most current remotes use this silicone PCB board which printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED in the sequence on and off bursts. What kind of things do we have to consider there? What kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of Mm-hmm. The the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that that it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the size of the nine buttons in. If you see how thin the tracks are, you could you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one, if you wanted to but there is an option to do it like that, or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode while not being used. Okay. Okay. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a TV remote, but you could have lights behind the buttons and after five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up. Mm-hmm. Okay. The case material, I've been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the main problems with the you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Mm-hmm. Titanium very expensive just to process, which to make it is expensive, and rubber, you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year, so perhaps something made of rubber, but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti RSI. Mm. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. I'm I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. The problem with the casing is that there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone. And second question is a mobile you can change the cover, call it a skin or whatever. Hinged. Yeah. So in this case if you're looking at a customer can change the colour from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that. Mm. I. So is that feature available in titanium, or it's only specific to plastic or Mm-hmm. In titanium I don't think it would be available at all really, just it you could make it available in the titanium, it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote. Mm-hmm. It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it. I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have a rubber cover that goes over, that would give the spongy feel, that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone. Rubber. And you can peel them off. So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be those pens that you get with the grip, that you can pull that off. Yeah. A rubber sleeve almost. Yeah. Something like Alright. Yeah. Mm. That could be a good idea. Mm. Hmm. It could it would be comfortable to hold on also. Okay. Mm. Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to. Yeah. That's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not. Mm. Yeah. Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, the I we were planning to do some sort of touch screen. Kay. Mm-hmm. Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough, that would be one option. The second option they offer rubber buttons, but I thought that an LCD type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space, two you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch display. Sorry I didn't get the last part, you're talking of Just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely, you're saying Uh-huh. What on the LCD screen you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it, but you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off, you wouldn't have that with the LCD, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Also with the. I don't see why the curved thing is a problem, if we for example had a shell, once we open that so it'd be. It would be flat inside. You could have a flat screen inside, but I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside. Mm. Have I misunderstood you? Full colour, it would just be black and white, but there'd be touch buttons, so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em, or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-RSI. Mm-hmm. Kay. Mm-hmm. I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside. Is rubber. Yeah. Mm. Now if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press, one of the palm pop thing. I hadn't really thought of that to be honest. I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the RSI. Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside a small pointer thing when people want to. You could, have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I think they could get a bit easily lost, 'cause I had. Mm. Yeah. Absolutely, for somebody who very often, if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever. They're easy to replace as well, cheap. It would have to be attached. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? A pencil or a pen, so they wouldn't really need a Mm-hmm. Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that. That's that's the end of my. That's you, right okay. And just one small question before you are, regarding the circuit, since we are having a flip-top, we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing, so we can divide the circuit. That would be fairly simple, you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or some cabling between them, 'cause in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me, it kind of applies to both our designers here, so I'm not sure how it would fit in. Mm. If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives an advertising display, you seen those? No. And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display the remote control display thing. We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women. Um. They don't look at themselves? Just a thought. It's a remote control, you were watching TV are you gonna want to sort of open it and say shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T Yeah, no, no. Yeah. I know what you mean, it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think, okay. Trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side. Mm. Yeah. Kay. Okay. You could do it, you could have a 'cause if you just put the full charge through an LCD display it'll completely blank it out, but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it, I'm not sure about. Mm. I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought. Okay, okay. Okay, would like to share something which I did here. First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy, they are bored of black and white. Mm. So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. And second thing is there's too much of confusion here. Mm. No particular remote is standard. Some people have a Here you see this? I I found that only common feature is the channel control and volume control, rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and all. Okay. Okay, and second as already discussed with William, we are going to have maybe a G GUI interface in the middle of the flip-top and graphic user interface basically which is what we do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever, which is Like you have on a icons or something you have is a good example of GUI graphic user interface. Yeah. Sorry what does that stand for? Which means Okay. Okay. Yeah. If if you have buttons that appear in this LCD screen. Yeah. So basically not point or click Press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify. Okay. And on the top repetitive buttons which are volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device, that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer. Mm-hmm. So we are having a combination of boards, so on the simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels. Can we swap that round so that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone. Yeah. No you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? If we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your LCD display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand. Yeah. But you can do it with your thumb. That's what I was just saying, and then have the and then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls, so have the volume and the programme, things like that, on the lower side. But Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay and you mean to the And the lower distance. Perfect. Hmm. Okay. So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain buttons which I already explained, example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and inconsistent. Okay there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature. We have to check for financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost, but for we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it. So it could be where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here. Yeah. Some kind of thing or it gives a bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more can say trendy also? Mm. And technologically innovative also. Yeah. So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be as already marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have, for example, if you see the previous slide I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern, here, so we we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls. Mm. Yeah. We. I can't see that, is that play and stop and things? This is central one, the one volume and channel. Or is that volume and channel? So keep that that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models, if you look at all the models, it's here. This and voice recognition. Okay. Right. Okay. I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about the things we've discussed. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery? Kinetic? The kinetic. Yeah. Yeah. That means that there's no function for the port, that it sits in, then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for finding it. Mm. I think if it is it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them, or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them. It's a it's like a it's a gadget, it's a selling point. Mm-hmm. Do you reckon that's a good idea that, where's the remote, I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun. Mm. I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. It's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one, they use them in calculators so. The LCD's not cheap. Hmm. Okay. Maybe we could start with the black and white. Yeah. That that way we could upgrade later. And you could. We talked about kinetic? Okay. Mm. Mm. You. Do you want a back-up? No, one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A or triple A batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they? No the kinetic ones come with a sort of watch a battery that goes in a watch. I see. Right, okay, got you. So it's a lot smaller, so it would. Got you on that okay, didn't realise. Okay so we've got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? Yeah. So there's not really a decision to be made there. The buttons what did you give us as The bare-board LCD or On the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then Okay, okay. I think we're going for the LCD on that one, on the buttons, on the on on the top one we're gonna. On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, the anti-RSI ones. Sorry could you repeat that last part? Okay we've got the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the LCD and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. LCD screen. Mm-hmm. Okay. And for the sorry. No, it's fine. For the body design I think plastic, we could use the body, for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip, something to add to the design. Plastic, okay. For the inside. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, okay. Right. I think so. And although it's rubberised and spongy, apart from that we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, just go for the colours. Mm no. No I think we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway the fact the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic, we could make it black and white zebra stripes, but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the yes. I it's different. Okay. Mm-hmm. The feel. So we could just pick anything. Kay. Mm-hmm. Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size, made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted, market research, is that fancy? It's just different from everything else and I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses, sort of beige and black so you either want something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway, or you want something that contrasts as you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else, but I totally agree. We looked at those remotes, they are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things. This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be relatively cheap to produce, that if in a year's time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on, which is another beauty of it. And you would have so many different options that you could do, you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little Mm. And ones that have rubbery spikes you could just go so far with it, like a puffer fish, you could take it wherever, I think that's quite a flexible thing. Right. You can just. Acupressure, you could talk of acupressures. Yeah. And finally the body should be retouchable, maybe you can change the body or the case casing the case outside, it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time. Yes. With these rubberised not the actual plastic outside case, just the rubber thing that goes round the outside. Mm. Okay. The rubber. Yeah. Okay we've got five minutes, or that might've been up for a while. Mm, so can I just recap Sarah, for the decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch-type batteries, LCD display on the top side of the flip top, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, the case itself is plastic. Fine. Yeah. That's how far we've got, what else do we have to add to our decisions here? Fine, we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it's lost. Mm. Mm-hmm. Are we looking at voice? Yes, there was just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost, is that right? Or maybe William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains. For the whistle. The whistle ones. So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. And incorporating the company logo? Yep. Have you Okay. Sorry I didn't mention this, but we'll be incorporating in the design. Mm. Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from from your report, it's not just a case of having a little RR hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they? They do, but I think we can you could it is, I think you just address that with advertising. Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours. Yeah. You associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you. Yeah. Okay. Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does, without that so I'm not worried about that. Okay. Okay. Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper, I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location, have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then? Depending on how we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into, so that seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else, then it's worth thinking about. Depending on the expense of it. And they've got in stock, so. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards. Yeah. Right I'm going to wrap it up there. Okay. Fine. I got a end meeting now message on my so. Mm-hmm. Did it? Yeah. Again a questionnaire? So closing we have forty minutes so I think we've probably got about that time before we come back. You got to go through. It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took. I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now. Is everyone happy? Okay.",
