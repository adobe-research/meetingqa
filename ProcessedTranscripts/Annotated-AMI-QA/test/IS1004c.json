    "displayText": "Okay? Good afternoon. Hope you have good lunch. Afternoon. Hi. We had falafel. Oh. Nice. And you? Yes, I had something similar but non-vegetarian. Okay. So today is our third meeting. It will be about the conceptual design. If I come back to the minutes of the last meetings. We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of LCD screen on on the remote control because of costs. So maybe we will be able to clarify this this question today. At the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point. So I hope that your respective presentations will help us. So each of you have some presentation to perform who starts? Okay. So marketing. So you are you saved your your presentation somewhere? Yep. So you're four? Four. Which is trend watch. Okay. Mr Marketing Experts. That's me. So Mm-hmm. Uh. I investigate deeper the preference of the users. So the current investigation sorry the current trends? Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Okay. What I found can you. Next slide? Yeah. Thank you. What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device. After they want something new technologically speaking, but what they find more interesting, more or more important it's a fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current trend which was the functional look and feel. So now more cool aspect, more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of a device which can do many things, a device which is pleasant to watch, to see. Okay. Also in in in Paris and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the current trend of clothes, furniture and all this fashion it's fruit and the the theme is fruit and vegetables. Mm. And also in the in the USA the the current the the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy. Spongy means eponge? Mm-hmm. So maybe we should we should think in in this direction, so Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan? What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy? What you mean No, I missed that one. Spongy means it's But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote? I didn't miss I didn't miss and I saw that there are many pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes. They're okay so they're not dressed as a carrot they just have pictures of fruit on, okay. No no, not not yet, not yet. So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of a banana, just maybe Okay and So which fruit are you thinking of? So textures. Yeah. Vegetable textures and all this kind. Drawings of bananas. Uh-huh. So this is in the next slide certainly. No no, it's not. It's not? It's And. I haven't thought of any particular fruit, but the general aspect of the remote control may could remind some kind of vegetable, some kind of instead of vegetable, some mm natural object or something. Mm-hmm. But it depends on maybe the shape not not not too much focus, not too not too similar to a fruit because next year the trend the trend will be different. So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the LCD. So you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit, or you want just some kind of fruit logo So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant. Means buttons are in the shape of fruits, buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something, apple, banana, something like that. Apple for channel one. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we shouldn't be really attached to the trend but For instance. African or as an elephant? That we can discuss afterwards. But okay, I'm not, really sure if that would really appeal to everyone though, maybe just to fashion gurus, maybe just a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner, but I don't know about dunno how ergonomic an orange is. Okay. Maybe we should further specify what target are we focusing. I think in my opinion we should focus on young people because they are more open to new new devices and also according to the marketing report ninety ninety five percent of young people was was able to buy a a cooler remote control. To fruit? But is fruit cool? What? That's a question. What? Is fruit cool? Yeah? Is the new trend of the No I think we should think about a shape with it a device with a shape of some. I guess, Apple has the iPod just 'cause they have an apple on their product, doesn't mean fruit is cool. Okay, but it has to be easy to use though and to hold you don't wanna pear or a watermelon. Don't you think we can find the shape of a fruit which is handy to use? Probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of, a cucumber. Banana. Mm-hmm. I dunno. Or Maybe. Maybe too long. Maybe. Too green. But you have to also fit all the buttons and. A banana. It The thing is normally with buttons, they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult kind of to build. I don't it will be rolling a lot. But I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons buttons do you want an LCD with twenty five Euros? Okay. And you you will not have a lot of place to put a LCD on a banana also. Yeah. The Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not. This is Okay. I think according to the report people are more interested in a fancy look and feel and in a technological innovation, so, I will give more importance to the look and feel rather than the new inputs and also I'm not convinced about this LCD because you need internet connection, you need more things, it's not just buying a new control remote, you need buying control remote, buying more things. So you you suggest to go Okay. So you're simply you're simply looking to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons. It's not so simple. For instance. For for given an example. Okay good. So maybe you can go ahead? No, it's what I already said. Okay. Thanks. Um. Okay, I'll give the floor. You are User Interface guy. So you're three? Yeah. And it's this one. Yep. Go for it. Yep. Okay. So. Next slide. Okay. So I received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample speaker unit, which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine or remote control. But it's just a speaker right? It's it's very It has a microphone, has a speaker, it's got a little chip and it allows you it's a sample sensor sample speaker. It's not a microphone. Mm-hmm. Actually I'm not reading microphone there, so that's why you can all have conversation, it just to speak to you. Sample sensor sample speaker. It means that it can recognize, it can do a match on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But there's no kind of understanding of the phrase. Okay. So, I guess you could link the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on the remote control. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But basically the thing is, we have this technology available in-house. In-house. But the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production of the components, so it but it basically means we can kind of consider this from a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about how to develop it because we have this already done. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Whilst some people might get annoyed if we just dump it, it it's, it's it'll recognize guess keywords, but keywords in a certain order like a phrase. I there's something that I unclear really understanding. Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords? You train it for a certain phrase, you say the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is they've actually integrated into the coffee machine that we're producing is, you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning, how would you like your coffee? And it's just to, it's just to playback something? Yeah. So actually that was a bad example, 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response, so. So this is not really to do to to do control. Only, in the sense that it can recognize a set target kind of word It's designed as a fun kind of thing, but I guess you could use it as a way to implement Completely pointless. Yeah. This is just more like a. So it's it it it is easy a fancy thing that you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any completely pointless for from the interaction point of view. But can we use it for saying okay, channel twenty? Yeah. Unless you like having conversation with your remote control. Okay. That's the thing, if you can but you have to though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination, you have to train it to learn channel fifteen, that whole thing, not just the word channel and the word fifteen, it doesn't have that kind of logic in it. So this is so this is this is much more than taking this technology, bringing it to the remote control and using it. Mm-hmm. So that would be some development work. So this is out of discussion. Yeah. So if if it is something that we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control No this is mm banana-bando. Mando. Banana-mando. Banana-mando. I I I don't think it's worth it though, I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine, so. Then it could be cool. Okay, let's go ahead. Okay. Okay. So if we can just move on to the next slide, I've just done a quick mock-up of some of the features of our potential funky-looking remote control see, I was unaware at this point of the fruit focus, so at the moment it's more of a box focus. It doesn't look like a banana at all. Yeah. But you can fit you're saying now you can fit it to. Looks like a look likes a a a tropical fruit. Yeah. This could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be square so that it packs tighter in the boxes. But I've just indicated here, we could have actually two scroll wheels, 'cause key part of, I think everyone has agreed that it could be quite a useful thing, so. Stable thing, that's right. To have, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But I think it's important, to have two scroll wheels because, you want one for the channel, but you also want one for the volume, because it's the volume it's, very handy for it to have instant kind of feedback and response, so. Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But I've also included this turbo button because I think, every design should have a turbo button, so this is a unique problem with televisions is that if you have this scroll wheel for the television, the tuner on the TV is not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll, so the person might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them, in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then, displays that station. What's a turbo button? Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it, even if it lags behind what they're doing. It it controls the speed? So with this turbo button you can, say, skip over channels if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel it's really going fast or whatever. So those are the two important features I think we need on the remote, but we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need. Mm-hmm. If we wanna have a very cheap kind of device, we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very, if it's gonna be a banana, that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality, it's just a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for some people more functional than their current remote, but if they have these scroll wheels, so, what other buttons do we want? It's enough. Mm-hmm. I guess you need an on and off switch, but you could you could turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe, it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing. Switch on. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds crazy. I like crazy ideas. That's why you're a marketing guru. Okay. Of course. So it looks like we're going completely to forget about the LCD thing. That's the thing, as have we decided that we can only spend, twenty five Euro? I think that No we can't use that. Not spend, but charge twenty five Euro. I I think we could use somehow the coffee machine dialogue interface or so. You we can? We can't use that to communicate, it's just a thing No. We can't. Communicate. But we can say channel twenty five. It's one way. No? But then you have to have a template for a hundred channels, you have to be able to recognize Mm. It's not Ah, it's designed for a okay. Mm-hmm. I think it's probably more than, our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine, to say hello in the morning. Yeah. Is it design for a coffee machine? That's its current application, I would presume that they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things so. Okay. Yeah. Maybe the you could ask the engineering department if we can. Mm-hmm. Yeah. A good good good thing. But I just made the point, I don't know if that speech recognition is, even if we can do it, I think it's not really appropriate for television environment. You want to to move to your slides? That's right. You're finished? I think so. But I did have one thing from a previous meeting, you were talking about being able to find the remote control and I was talking about being able to extend the remote control by having a base station that can control other things as well. Mm-hmm. It might be useful to have some kind of base station, even if it's just you press on a button on it and the remote control starts beeping, this is a way of finding the remote. In that case maybe the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here but it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a beeping It's speech synthesis and it's speech kind of, not really speech recognition, but kind of pattern matching. Mm. Exactly. So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing, something has been stored and it's just spoken out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's right. Good idea. Very good. Okay, let's move on. So you're two? That's right. Okay. So this is going to be about the component design. Mm-hmm. So first thing is we need power source for the remote control. So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies, one is the usual batteries which are there, they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells, when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty innovative kind. Then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces, there should be some flexibility in. I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy. Yeah. So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve. The science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve. Then controls for the traditionals traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them. So, just one second, when you say double curve, what do you actually mean? You reckon you could draw us a thing on the, whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure Okay, but kind of convex or concave? Double curve is, you have curves on both the sides if I'm right. So it's symmetrical kind of thing, whatever it is. So, it could be curve, so it could be convex, concave, depending on what what we want. Mm-hmm. Okay. So there are flats, there are single curve and there are double curves. Okay. These are the three things, and there are different materials, with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve. So there was there were many other materials like wood, titanium and all those things, but plastic is the most appropriate one, it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's Wooden cases Mm-hmm. Yeah. Although, wood could be quite a stylish option, if you take nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some, varnish on. Mm but there is no elasticity but the components inside. It depends, the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken, it's the inside. But inside you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the user. Yeah. Very too expensive to do. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well. And also but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood. That's true, but are we set on the banana idea? Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy. It looks like you are all targeting that? Yes it is. I don't know the name in English it's not a fruit it's a vegetable. Is it an apple which Banana is more handier as compared to this and to capsicum. It's like a pumpkin or Green. Yeah? Pumpkin. Green. Green. Yes I see. What does it taste like? And you put in the salad. Pepperoni. Oui c'est ca Pepper. Ah what's it in French? Poivron. Okay, so capsicum or pepper. Pepper. Yeah. But they. And it also suits with the double curve for easy of No, I'm sure it's fun. It seems a little bit kind of bulky to me, with a banana you can have But a banana you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that, but with I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and So is that, when you say speaker support, it just has some output pinned which which which kind of Okay, but the speaker is actually attached to the chip in some way, or is just the signal? Yeah. It's not it you you think it's really fancy and fun? You think that young people that are. More than a banana? But banana is not so handy, I think that's handier. Yeah. It's kind of it's more it's really ergonomic, it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to put the controls. Okay let's move on. You're right. So time is running, let's move on. Okay, so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated, just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection, volume control and teletext browsing. These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that. Okay. We can go to the next slide. Then there are different kind of chips, one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an advanced chip. So we can have regular chip for control. Pricing is a factor for us, that's why we'll go for the regular chip. And regular chip supports speaker support, so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced. It could be a beep kind of thing. Yes, yes, that's right, it's onto the chip, most probably, not hundred per cent sure about that. Okay. Okay. Are there any issues where we place this chip to make sure you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana? That will be the volume control which a user it should be already pre-defined. It should be whatever will be the case, the chip is always going to be sitting inside. Okay. But the speaker, if the speaker is actually on the chip, then if it's too far away from the casing, or if the casing is too thick, then you may not hear the speaker. Mm-hmm. So we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better. Yeah. As or as hearing is concerned, we can have some gap at some place, so that That's right. Yeah. So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside. Okay. Yeah. So these these were the component selection and these things. We can go to the next slide. And these were the findings which I saw with the web web, that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control, so our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV, because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything, so with this additional little, we might be having slightly better market for us. Although, if we like, if we are concentrating on a fruit design, then maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit, a different fruit for each device. Mm. Of fruits. Mm-hmm. That, sometimes people like to collect things of a similar type. Remotes objects, okay. Objects. Crazy objects. I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits. You're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place. No but I think just one fruit to control everything. A power fruit. A power a power a Mando, a Supermando fruit. And as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing and we should have it on the remote. Yeah. Okay. Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control. I think that's a pretty handy feature. Okay, good. So you're having a basis station. Okay. Your usually your remote sits on that. So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries. Now let's say Basis station is with the thing. So you you have to buy two things, the banana and the basis station. It's it's. You you you thing. It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there. So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries, they're rechargeable batteries, so over the period of time he'll recover the cost. So you're having the basis station and there is a button, if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think people would find that worth it even if it wasn't a recharging station, even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries. But I'm a bit worried about the budget. So Although you do need to include RF kind of circuitry in the remote. Basis station is nothing more, just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the thing sits. Mm-hmm. That's right. But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems. So component cost is going to be the least. Anyway, we are not using really advanced technology, LCD has already been ruled out, ASR has been ruled out. So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly. Okay. And Mm-hmm. I'm just wondering actually, 'cause, this whole fruit thing with the banana, it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of niche, like only a few people would really want a banana, but what if it was kind of a stylised banana? Rather than having it kind of yellow and really looking exactly like a banana, you could make it kind of silver. And to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking completely kitsch. For better want of a better word? You think that yellow it's kitsch. I don't know how many this colour Maybe, still in the shape of a banana. If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana. Yeah. No, I Maybe like that. Otherwise it'll means you don't get any feeling then. Otherwise Roughly. It's neither a banana nor a And going to the last slide. No, exactly. Exactly. But maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of, because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to give the texture of a banana anyway and to have the exact shape. I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of, twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies. Yeah. Okay. Let's move on. Before before before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the future prototype. Okay. Go for it. Okay. No, not you, can finish your slides before Mm okay. Okay. Okay, so. Anyway, users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes. So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody. Okay. That's it. That's all? Yep. Okay, mm so well done for the presentations. So we need to take some decisions about what we're going to do. So I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had during these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the final product and where Superman go banana and extra functionalities such as wheels, the speaker unit not in order not to lost the device, I don't remember you call it? Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. That's right. The basis station. Basis station. That's right. So we're going for a stylish banana shape. So, I guess you wanna hold the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as you maybe wanna kinda hold a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor. Right. So if you have Okay, so okay, so I guess we need, something that can fit a banana shaped object. What about what about this shape? More or less. If it if it has really the model shape of a you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really at the thing. There's less space on this to put with the buttons. But how many buttons do we need? If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact, it's better. What about The base station. So time is running, we have to we have to we have to to move forward. So let's skip to this this this idea. Yeah. So we have this. We have a basis how do you call it? A base station. Right. We'll have a base station extra on the side. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We have a RF for beeping for beeping. We need that. We need RF to beep. Okay, so it's. So we that means we need a button on on the on the basis. Basis station. Basis station, thank you. Alright, so we need okay. Can you go quickly please? Yeah. Okay. So we are going to add also as you suggested some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your turbo button. Yeah. Which I think it's probably best actually on the underneath of the device, so you have Yes. Turbo button. On the maybe here. And the and the wheel at the level of the thumb for instance. So you have the thumb kind of here. And and you have two wheels. So you need one here and one on the other side, so you got volume and channel. Okay right. Good. And, No LCD. So no LCD. Okay great. Um. Very good. Okay. We need a power off switch as well. Yeah. For the remote? Yeah. Just the switch, no not for the TV. Remotes don't have power on off switch. Yeah. So you On the side. Okay. No, that'll be controlled by those buttons'll be there already. What What about Four millions? Where? Means on the remote. Because remote is going to have both the interfaces, scroll as well as buttons. Okay. They are not going to cost you much, everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this. I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a banana remote in the first place. That's that's another issue which I didn't think of. You need to kind of keep it how many of these did we wanna sell? But our targets are very high, means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make. I can't remember, what was but how many units did we need to sell? Twenty five. Twelve point five is the profit on one. Twenty five. Forty four. Point point four million? Four point four million. Point four million. That's a lot of fruit. Yeah. In the market. What about a I what about adding the this word spotting, keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down? So. Well. No. Time is running, we have to close the meeting in a few minutes. Okay. So, okay, the next step, you can come back to your seat. Okay. The next step is to go to building a prototype, based on this, okay? Okay. So next meeting you guys have to prepare the things. You have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface, in fact you two you have to work together to model the first prototype. Mm-hmm. Marketing Expert have to go to product evaluation. Okay? It's too difficult. It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot, just a few five words. It's not a it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype, so it's in the next prototype so let's skip it. Uh. Okay. For the future prototypes. Maybe, if if it works we'll go for an orange one. That can be the turbo banana plus plus commando. Honour the fruit. Plus okay. Maybe objective banana? Okay. Thanks very much. We'll see next meeting. Bye. So meeting's over? Okay. Yep. Okay. We have to go design the prototype. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",
