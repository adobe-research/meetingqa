    "displayText": "Kay. Okay. Gosh. Kay. Does anyone want to see Steve's feedback from the specification? Is there much more in it than he Is there much more in it than he said yesterday? I I dry-read it the last time. Right. Not really, just what he's talking about, duplication of effort and duplication of effort and stuff, he was saying that we should maybe think about having a prototype for week six, which is next week. Mm. Hmm. Hmm? Next week. Yeah. So we should probably prioritize our packages. Now I'd say for the prototype if we just wherever possible chunk in the stuff that we have pre-annotated and stuff, and for the stuff that we don't have pre-annotated write like a stupid baseline, then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on the interface first sort of, so that we take the ready-made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and then we have a working prototype. Mm. And then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated components of our own. So it's probably feasible. Yeah. The thing is I'm away this weekend. Yeah. So that's for me. If we just want to have some data for the user face, could even be random data. Yeah. No. But also I might like the the similarity thing, like my just my matrix itself for my stuff, I I I think I can do that fairly quickly because I have the algorithms. Mm mm I'm. I think today's meeting is really the one where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that, probably after today's meeting, we then actually need to go back first of all and look at NITE XML to see in how far that which we want is compatible with that which NITE XML offers us. Yeah. And then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface. Yeah. So I think if today we decide on what data we wanna have now, and and later, maybe even today, we go and look at NITE XML or some of us look at NITE XML in a bit more detail, just trying to make some sense of that code and see how does the representation work in their system. And then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay, that type of NITE XML data we wanna load into it, and this is how everyone can access it, and then we should be able to go from there. Hmm. Has anyone actually looked at the Java code for the? No. No. Hmm. I've looked at the documentation and seen enough to make me think that we want to use the NITE XML framework because they have a good event model that synchronizes sort of the data and every display element. So that takes a lot of work away from us. Sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework and using their general classes. But beyond that I haven't looked at it at all, which is something we should really do. I think so. Who actually for this whole discussion who of us is doing stuff that is happening on-line and who of us is doing stuff that's happening off-line? My data is coming? The basic word importance is off-line as well. Yeah. The combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search. Okay. Okay. Mine's gonna be mostly using the off-line. But the actual stuff it's doing will be on-line. But it won't be very processor intensive or memory intensive, I don't think. Kay. So basically apart from the display module, the the display itself, we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our modules that create the stuff and and the interface, so the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file, I guess. I know. I don't know about the search functionality, that might be online. Depends how it's gonna work. I guess the search is sort of a strange beast anyway because for the search we're leaving the NITE XML framework. Yeah. But that's good. That means that at least we don't have the type of situation where somebody has to do a billion calculations on data on-line. Cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and and everything. And nobody is modifying that data at at on-line time at all it seems. Nobody's making any changes to the actual data on-line. Don't think so. So that's actually making it a lot easier. That basically means our browser really is a viewer mostly, which isn't doing much with the data except for sort of selecting a piece piece of it and and displaying it. Yeah. Are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database? Hmm? Are we still gonna dump it into a database? Some parts relevant for the search, yes. I'd say so. Cause if we are, I reckon we should all read our classes out of the database. It'll be so much easier. Hmm? If we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway, we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database, calculate everything from there. Then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying XML representation. We can just query it. But nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the on-line stage. And for all together, the display itself, I think we are easier if it's sitting on the XML than if it's sitting on the SQL stuff, because if it's sitting on the XML, we have the NITE XML framework with all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change, whenever something's moving forward and stuff. And we can just more or less look at their code, like how their player moves forward, and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff. So I think in the actual browser itself I don't wanna sit on the SQL if we can sit on the XML because sitting on the XML we have all we have so much help. And for the calculations that we're doing apart from the search, it seems that everyone needs some special representations anyway. If we're gonna do that, we should try and store everything in an XML format as well. You mean our results? Yeah. In the NITE XML XML format, with their time stamps and stuff, so that it's easy to tie together things. Yes. Yeah. What we have to think about is if we go with this multi-level idea, like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity, as one thing that you display, as one whole sort of, that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings, whereas and then you can click on a meeting, and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments, that means sort of we have multiple levels of representation, which we have to discuss that if we do it this way, then we should probably find some abstraction model, so deals with it as if it's same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting, what? Mm-hmm. Yes. And that's probably stuff that we have to sort of process twice then. For example that the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus or meeting series is meeting series a good word for that? I don't really know what how to call it. What I mean, not the whole corpus, but every meeting that has to do with one topic. Hmm. That makes sense. So in the meeting series so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series, are sort of compiled off-line by a summary module. And that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting. Cause I don't think we can So are we doing that at all levels? We don't even need to do that, 'cause if we got our information density calculated off-line, all we do is treat the whole lot as one massive document. I'm not so sure. It's not gonna be so big that we can't load in a information density for every utterance. And we can just summarise based on that. I thought we would just have one big summary with all the different importance levels displayed on it. And depending on what our zoom level is, we just display a part of it. And just have different fine-grainedness levels sort of. And we would have one very big thing off-line. And from that we would just select what we are displaying. Yes. So for example you would give a high value to those sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary. Mm. Kay. So the only thing that would happen basically if I double-click let's say from the whole meeting series on a single meeting, is that the zoom level changes. And you just cut off. The start and the end position changes and the zoom level changes. That was what I thought. I think you can do it on-line. I I thought we couldn't do that. I thought. I was under the impression that we couldn't do that because we couldn't load the data for all that. But that So I'm not sure if I got it. Hmm. I don't think there's really much point in doing like that when it's just gonna feed off in the end the information density measure basically. And that's all calculated off-line. So what you're really doing is sorting a list, is the computationally hard part of it. I was Mm-hmm. The ideas we're calculating are information density all off-line first for every utterance in the whole corpus, right? Mm-hmm. So what you do is if you're looking at a series of meetings, you just say our whole document comprises of all these stuck together. Mm-hmm. And then all you have to do is sort them by information density. Mm-hmm. Maybe weighted with the search terms, and then extract them. Okay. So Okay. I don't think it's too slow to do on-line, to be honest. I I was just worried about the total memory complexity of it. But I completely admit, I just sort of took that from some thing that Jonathan once said about not loading everything. But maybe I was just wrong about it. How many utterances and I. Is that. But I think the difference might be that we just want to have the words. And that's not so much what he meant with not possibly loading everything was that you load all the annotation stuff, all the sound files, all In I I'm getting quite lost at the moment because what's our difference between the importance measure and the skimming? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So what we have is we would have a word. We would have words with some priority levels. And they would basically be because even the selection would the summaries automatically feed from just how prioritized an individual word or how prioritized an individual utterance is? Or are the summaries sort of refined from it and made by a machine to make sentences and stuff? Or are they just sort of taking out the words with the highest priority and then the words of the second highest priority? On the utterance level I was thinking. So the utterances with the highest mean information density. And the okay. Are we doing it on the whole thing on the utterance level? Or are we doing it on word level, like the information density calculation? The trouble with doing it on the word level is if you want the audio to synch up, you've got no way of getting in and extracting just that word. It's impossible. I think we have start and end times for words actually, but it might but it might sound crazy in the player. For every single word? Yeah. Okay. We should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works. Yeah. I don't think that will do it. But there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on an utterance level in the end. We'll have to buffer it. So. Do we do both or is it the same thing? The skimming's gonna use the importance. Okay. But at first it's just gonna be IDF. But when we talk about summaries you talk about skimming and not about. Mostly skimming. But also about the displays, in the text body, in the latest draft that we had sort of we came up with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance for utterance, but it's also displaying a summarised version below the graph, the part. Maybe? Right, isn't that the skimming? Isn't that the skimming? It's just like there's audio skimming and there's displayed skimming. But it use the same data. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there's some merit of going altogether for utterance level and not even bother to calculate if you have to do it internally, then you can do it. But maybe not even store the importance levels for individual words and just sort of rank utterances as a whole. The nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences. More or less. Hmm? Yeah. So it will make more sense, and if you get just extract words. Cause it it might be better skimming and less memory required at the same time. And if you know how to do it for individual words, then you can just in the worst case, if you can't find anything else, just sort of make the mean of the words over the utterance. You know what I mean? So what you want to do it, you just wanted to assign I thought about words. It's what's the smallest chunk at the moment you're thinking of assigning an importance measure to, is it a word or is it an utterance? So we're thinking of maybe just storing it on a per utterance level. Because it's it's less stuff to store probably for Dave in the in the audio playing. Mm. And in the display it's probably better if you have whole utterances than I don't know, what it's like if you just take single words out of utterances. Yeah. That probably doesn't make any sense at all, whereas if you just show important utterances but the utterance as a whole it makes more sense. And, I think we also thought about combining that measure with the measures I get from hot-spots and so on. Yeah. So it doesn't actually make a difference for your algorithm, 'cause it just means that if you're working on a word level, then we just mean it over the utterance. Mm okay. They are on so that's good anyway then. So that would also be on utterance level, I think. I think. I see it. Because that makes it a lot easier than to put it on utterance level. But it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense. No but how Jasmine does it internally don't but you probably have to work on word levels for importance. Yeah. But there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance level. I reckon you can just mean it over the sentence. Okay. But how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all, the and uhs and something like that. Because if we average average over a whole utterance all the words, and there are quite unimportant words in there, but quite important words as well, I think we should just disregard the Okay. I think we should filter them. Maybe we should have a cut-off. So it a word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold. So anything that has less than say nought point five importance gets assigned to zero. Alright. We do a pre-filtering of sort of the whole thing, sort of like but the problem with that is it's easy to do in the text level. That's the other. But that would mean it would still play in your audio, unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio. Yeah. I think before we can answer that specific question how we deal with that, it's probably good for us to look at what the audio player is capable of doing. I think we'll have to buffer the audio. But I don't think it will be very hard. Yes. I think it would be an hour or two's work. So what do you mean by buffering? You think directly feeding But not but not stored on the hard disk and then loaded in, but loaded in directly from memory. Just build another wave file essentially. You just concatenate them together. I bet there would be packages In memory. So just like there's bound to be a media wave object or something like that. And just build one in memory. But it's probably a stream if it exists in Java, it would be probably some binary stream going in of some type. I don't know. I have no idea. Okay. But it must have classes for dealing with files. And if it has classes for concatenating files, you can do it in memory. Okay. Okay, so that means that even if you go on an per utterance level, there's still some merit within utterances cutting out stuff which clearly isn't relevant at all, and that maybe also for the audio we'd have to do. What I think I might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of different wave-forms, and it will just string them all together with maybe, don't tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that. So let's say we play the whole phrase, but then in addition to that, we have some information that says minus that part of something. That's okay, that we can do. Maybe even that depends on how advanced we get. If maybe if we realise that there's massive differences in in gain or in something, you can probably just make some simple simple normalization, but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary. Normalise it. I don't know anything about audio and I have never seen the player. So if you find that the player accepts some input from memory, and if it's easy to do, then I guess that's that's fairly doable. But that means in the general structure we're actually quite lucky, so we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings just the utterances and rankings for the utterances and some information probably that says, guess that goes with the utterance, who's speaking. We'll need that. Yes, sure. Because then we can also do the display about who's speaking. We also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well. Yeah. But I'm still confused 'cause I thought that's just what Jonathan said that we can't load a massive document of that size. It doesn't matter, 'cause all the calculation's done off-line. On the other hand it shouldn't be should be fifty mega-byte in RAM or something, it shouldn't be massive, should it? Actually fifty hundred megabyte is quite big in RAM. Hmm. Just thinking, what's the so We do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load. So we know that doesn't work. So our hope is essentially that we load less into it. Yes. Yeah. What's this lazy loading thing, somebody explain lazy loading to me. It just means it loads on demand. It only loads when it needs a particular type of file. When it's being accessed. Ah, okay. So that is that only by type of file. If if the same thing is in different files, would it then maybe if utterances are split over three or ten or hundred different files, is then a chance maybe that it doesn't try to load them all into memory at the same time, but just So why does it fail then in the first place? I think that's the idea, it just loads the particular ones it needs. Then it shouldn't ever fail, because then it should never but it it failed right when you load it, right, the NITE XML kit, so that's interesting. But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all. Yes, right. Hmm. Oops, it does. So I define baseline and what it loads? For example it loads all the utterances and so on, but it doesn't load the discourse acts and for example and what's what else there? Hmm. Not the summaries. It only loads those on demand. Let's check that out. I'll probably ask Jonathan about it. So alternatively, if we realise we can't do the whole thing in one go, we can probably just process some sort of meta-data, sort of for the whole series chunks representing the individual meetings or something that represents the whole series in a in a structure very similar to the structure in which we represent individual meetings, but with data sort of always combined from the whole series. So instead of having an single utterance that we display, that would be representing a whole topic, a segment in a meeting. And sort of so that using the same data in a sense I'm thinking of in a sense of creating a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting series, sort of. You mean that you basically split up the big thing into different summaries. For example that you have a very top-level summary and a separate file for each level. That's easy. You just create a new XML document in memory. Sort of off-line create a virtual meeting, which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting, and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments, and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were utterances. So we just sort of we shift it one level up. Mm-hmm. And in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just make one or two ifs that say okay, if you are on a whole document a whole series level and that was a double-click, then don't just go into that segment, but load a new file or something like it, but in general use the same algorithm. That would be an alternative if we can't actually load the whole thing 'Cause also maybe this whole maybe I'm worrying too much about the whole series in one thing display, because actually probably users wouldn't view that one too often. Mm. I don't think it's really that much of a problem because if it's too big, what we can do is just all the off-line stuff doesn't really matter. And all we can do is just process a bit at a time. For summarisation, say we wanted a hundred utterances in the summary, just look at the meeting, take the top one hundred utterances in each other meeting. If it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far, just replace them. And then you only have to process one meeting at a time. But I'm still worried. For example for the display, if you want a display for the whole series, the information density levels based on and the only granularity you have is individual utterances, that means you have to through every single utterance in a series of seventy hours of meetings. Okay, so maybe we should build a store a mean measure for the segments and meetings as well? Yeah. And if you make that structurally very similar to the one level down, like the way how we store individual utterances and stuff, then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff. So but still so in general we're having utterances and they have a score. And that's as much as we really need. And of and they also have a time a time information of course. And speaker. Hmm? And a and a speaker information. Speaker and topic segmenting we'll need as well. So an information which topic they're in. Yeah. And probably separate to an information about the different topics like that. So the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs. And then it'll preserve the order when it's displayed the. It'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining. Yeah. But that's enough data for the skimming and the searching, so what the searching does is the whole framework, goes to the SQL database and basically in the end gets just a time marker for where that is, that utterance that we are concerned with. I think so. And then we have to find I'm sure there's some way in NITE XML to just say set position to that time mark. And then it shifts the whole frame and it alerts every single element of the display and the display updates. Hmm. We do not want it to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results. But that'd be quite easy to do. That we can but so if so. So if in that tree display somebody clicks on something and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the NITE XML central manager, and that central manager alerts everything that's there, alerts the the audio display, alerts the text display, alerts the visual display and says we have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom. You just need to find the time stamp. Yeah. How much do they display, and starting position at where the or maybe the mid-position of it, don't if start where the thing was found or if that thing was found it's in the middle of the part that we display, that I don't know. But that we can decide about, but a general sort of It's the same thing whether you play and it moves forward or whether you jump to a position through search, it's essentially for all the window handling, it's the same event. Yeah. It's only that the event gets triggered by the search routine which sort of push that into NITE XML and says please go there now. So we should basically make our own XML document in memory that everyone's module changes that, rather than the underlying data. And then have that NITE XML document tied to the interface. Why do we have to do it in memory? But the information is coming from off-line. You can make it in a file if you want. So we don't even have to change the utterance document, right, because the whole way, the whole beauty of the NITE XML is that it ties together lots of different files. So we can just create an additional XML file which for every utterance like the utterances have IDs presume, some references. Mm-hmm. So we tie just a very short XML file, which it's the only information it has that has whatever a number for the weight, for the information density, and we just tie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker changes. Yeah. Yes. But there is no ID for an utterance I think. It's just for individual words. How do we do that then? No no, it's for No, you're right. We for utterances as well. Yeah. I think it's just for one word. No, I think we would just take the segments that were there's this segments file. I think those segments for each utterance are split up. So we have to. Think so. Otherwise we probably have to go over it and add some integer that we just increment from top to bottom sort of to every utterance as an ID some type. Or or try to understand how NITE XML IDs work and maybe there's some special route we have to follow when we use these IDs. I'm pretty sure it's already there. It's? Pretty sure that's already there. The the utterances are numbered. The girl said the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment. I'm not quite sure, I have only seen that the individual words have got an ID. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So I guess that would be solvable if not. Yeah. You always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that belong together to form an utterance. Mm-hmm. Sorry? If they are already, it's easy but it would be possible. Okay. The XML segments. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Is that a board marker pen actually? Oh. That I don't know. Oh. I think so. That's just so like to make a list of all this stuff, or we probably can somebody can do it on paper. All these fancy pens. So what so the stuff we have we have utterances and speakers and weights for utterances. So for every utterance sort of the utterance has a speaker and a weight which is coming from outside. Or we just tie it to it. And there is segments, which? They are utterances, aren't they? The segments are utterances, aren't they? That's the impression I get. So sorry. Yeah. That's Mm-hmm. Topic segments I meant. They are a super-unit. Alright, okay. So so the utterances are tied to topic segments. Oh. And if the time stamps are on a word level, then we somehow have to extract time stamps for utterances where they start. There are time stamps for, segments and for segments for example when you look at the data, what is displayed in one line. That's easy. What segments now? Okay. Hmm. What when you look at it in the? Is that the same as utterances that is that the same as utterances that Mm-hmm. Mm. It's close enough, isn't it? I think so. For I compared it with what I did for the pause duration extraction. Right. It may not be exact every time, but it's a sort of size we're looking for. Mm-hmm. And basically it's words that are uttered in a sequence without pauses. But sometimes however there are short pauses in it and they're indicated by square brackets pause or something in the data. What so that's. But that's one one segment or is that two segments then? But the annotators decided what was one segment and what wasn't. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But but generally utterances is that which we just called sorry, segments is that which we just called utterances now. It's the it's sort of like one person's contribution at a time sort of thingy dingy. I think so. Okay. Okay, so we have those, and then we have some field somewhere else which has topics. Topics. And basically they are just on the ID, probably with a start time or something, and the utterances referenced to those topics I guess. I think that's the right one. So the topics don't contain any redundant thing of showing the whole topic again, but they just sort of say a number and where they start and where they finish. And the utterances then say which topic they belong to. Hmm. But I think for some annotations an utterance can have several types. For example for the dialogue acts and so on. Yeah. No. But I was thinking of the topic segmentation now and for that there would only be one, right, because it's sort of like it's just a time window. Okay. That should be for. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Should be. Yeah. So if this lazy loading works, then this should definitely fit into not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory at the same time. So if we just have those sort of that information like a long list of all the utterances slash segments and short or smaller lists which give weight to them. And even though probably if there's a lot of over-head in having two different files, we can probably merge the weights into it off-line. What I mean, if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has the weight for the other, then it's probably quicker to just I thought that was the whole beauty that you can just make a new XML file and sort of tie that to the other and it. Yeah. But why don't we just write it as a new XML file? Can handle just loading arbitrary new attributes and stuff? I would have thought they'd make it able to. Yeah. So why do we need to have two XML trees in memory at once? So no, I didn't mean tree. No. No. I meant just like handling two different files internally. Sort of I was just thinking if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from two files instead of from one file is massive then it would probably be for us easy to just off-line put the weight into the file that has the segments, segments slash utterances already. But that we can figure out if it's going horrendously wrong. The other thing is that would mean we'd be using their parser as well, which means we wouldn't have to parse anything, which be quite nice. Yeah. Cause their parser is probably much faster than anything we've come up with anyway. Yeah. No, we'd be completely using the whole infrastructure and basically just the main difference really between our project and theirs really is that we load a different part of the data. But otherwise we're doing it the same way that they are doing it. So we just we're sort of running different types of queries on it. In a sense I think we are running queries, it's not just about what we load and what we don't load, but we're running queries in the sense that we dynamically select by weights, don't we? That we have to check how fast that is, to say give us all the ones that whether that works with their query language, whether that's too many results and if 'cause let's say if their query language is strange and if it would return ten million results and it can't handle it, then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know what the threshold is. Mm. So they still get all the data and just they internally say no, this is less than three and I'm not gonna display it or something. We can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically. Hmm? We can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory. Yeah. No. I'm just thinking for this whole thing of a different level, sort of cutting out different different pieces, whether we do that through a query where we say give us everything that's above this and this weight, or whether we skip the same infrastructure, but every individual module like the player and the display say they still get sort of all the different utterances, all the different pieces, but they say this piece I leave out, because it's below the current threshold level. Hmm. I think we probably want to store Sorry. I think we probably want to store a hierarchical information density as well. So an mation density score for each meeting and each topic segment. Cause otherwise we'd be recalculating the same thing over and over and over again. That'd be much more efficient to do that. Yeah. Yeah. And that will obviously make it much easier to display. When do we need the one for the Okay. It may not for the whole meeting, but exactly. I guess so when we have the display, will we display the whole series. Then if we have for the individual topic segments within the meetings if we have ready calculated measures, then we don't have to sort of extract that data from the individual utterances. And that's also fairly easy to store along with our segments, isn't it. Yeah. For the segments, are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft with some fancy algorithm or manually or we're just taking the single most highly valued key-word utterance for the segment heading? We can start off like that. I've got sort of half-way through implementing one that does just IDF. Hmm. And then just I can change that to work on whatever. Hmm. In in the end probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the most highly ranked phrase or key-word because for example for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title anywhere similar to introduction or something. Yeah. Hmm. And it should be weighted by stuff like the hot spots and the key-words in the search and stuff like that. Yeah. Also for this part, maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end, if one of the people doing DIL has some named entity code to spare, and just at least for sort of for finding topics, titles for segments, just take a named entity which has a really high, what's it called, DFIDF, whatever. Hmm. Cause you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person, that would be a named entity which is very highly frequented in that part. Did he not say something about named entities? So I thought he said there wasn't very many. He said they're quite sparse. So that basically was don't bother basing too much of your general calculation on it. Yeah. But especially if they're sparse, probably individual named entities which describe what a segment is about would probably be quite good. If there's some name of some conference, they could probably say that name of the conference quite often, even though he's right that they make indirect references to it. Anyway Sorry? You said you are currently implementing the idea. What exactly are you computing? Yeah. It's not TFIDF, it's just inverse document frequency. Okay. Cause it's really easy to do basically. Okay. There's just for a baseline really. Mm-hmm. You're able to do that in Java? I'm half-way through. It's not working yet, but it will do. Yeah. So you're doing that on a on a per word level. Okay. And then averaging it over the utterances. Okay. But it's not related to the corpus at all. It's just working on an arbitrary text file at the moment. Okay, cool. I was just wondering where you had the corpus from at the moment. No. Huh. So it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem and that basically we don't have to have all these massive discussions of how we exactly interact with the data structure because most of our work isn't done with that data structure in memory in the browser, but it's just done off-line and everyone can represent it anyway they want as long as they sort of store it in a useful XML representation in the end. So that would mean understanding the NITE XML XML sort of format in a lot more detail. It would be useful to know how everyone's gonna store their things though. Hmm. Yeah. I think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and now that we know a bit more what we want, take a closer look at NITE XML. Yeah. I've got a few hours free. I've had a look at the topic segments, how it's stored. After this. Mm-hmm. And then those are few per meeting, and it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's the actual utterance segments. Mm-hmm. And the list of them that occurred. And they're all numbered. So that's where that's stored. Good. I haven't looked at this stuff much at all. So I guess if I'm gonna be segmenting it with a LC seg then that's same format I'd want to put it back out in so it'd be equivalent. Yeah. Yeah. Who's who's sort of doing the the the central coordination of of of the browser application now? Like the integration. What do you mean, integration? But also all these elements the loading and, integration and handling the data loading and stuff. Hmm. I don't know. I don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet. Nah. I'll take over the display, just because I've started with a bit and found it doable. Definitely. So somebody should sort of be the one person who understands most about what's centrally going on with the with the project, with the browser as a whole and where the data comes in and Any volunteers? It's the most boring task. Mm-hmm. It's also a complicated one. It could be difficult. Yeah. Yeah. But I guess we can do it it's probably just those people have to work together a lot and very closely and just make sure that. Yeah. I guess the important thing is to get the crucial modules built. Or at least simple versions of them. Yeah. Or ready-made versions of them for that matter but I think actually at the moment the integration comes first, at the moment the browser comes first, and then only comes creating new sophisticated data chunks, because that's sort of the whole thing about having a prototype system which is more or less working on chunk data. And then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it. But it at least we have the framework in which we can then test everything and and look at everything. Cause before we have that, it's gonna be very difficult for anyone to really see how much the work that they're doing is making sense because I guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual XML files files that you create, but it would be nice to have some basic system which just displays some stuff. So maybe we should try doing something really simple, like just displaying a whole meeting. And just being able to scroll through it or something like that. Or their just sort of go from their system and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could adapt it to our system. Yeah. Does anyone want to just sit with me and play for three hours with NITE XML at some point? Are you free after this? I wouldn't like to be 'cause I'd like to go to the gym. I'm theoretically free. But if there's any time? How about Friday then. Cause I'm off all Friday. You have nothing no free time on Wednesday. Wednesday I've got a nine 'til twelve. Hmm. Nine 'til twelve and then you have or you? Nothing in the afternoon. I've got nothing in the afternoon. So Okay. Anytime Wednesday afternoon I'd be cool, I think. So you. Where about, just in Appleton Tower? Yo, Forrest Hill, whatever one's easier to discuss stuff, I don't know. I'll be in the Appleton Tower anyway. I'm not biased. Okay. What time do you wanna do? I'll be there from twelve. I've got some other stuff that needs done on Matlab, so if you're not there at twelve, I can just work on that. Okay, so I'll just meet you in eighteen in the afternoon. So. I guess at the moment nobody critically depends on the NITE XML stuff working right now, right? At the moment you can all do your stuff and I can do my LSA stuff. Mm-hmm. And I can even do the display to a vast degree without actually having their supplying framework working. So it's not that crucial. I think so. I I would need the raw text pretty soon because I have to find out how I have to put the segments into bins. Actually I need the raw text as well. And then. But I was I was more thinking of sort of the whole browser framework as a running programme now. No, that's not necessary. I think we all need the raw text in different flavours, don't we? Hmm. Why. Jasmine, I thought you just said that you'd looked at extracting the text. Yes, I did. But I've just got the notes. To order everything by the time and I think it's quite easy after the. Yeah. So you said you did it in Python? Did you use the XML parser in Python? Yeah. Right. Sounds pretty good. So Mm-hmm. cause, I was having a look at it as well and I noticed the speakers are all in that separate file? So did did you have to combine them all and and then re-order them? That's what I was thought. That you just combine them and then order the time stamps accordingly. Yeah. Right. So that's approach I was going to do. So we may as well collaborate. Okay. What I found out was that there are quite a lot of things without time stamps in the beginning. In the word files? And XML files. Yes, but everything that's a word has a time stamp. That's just an ID or something. I don't know. Just numbers. Yes, but what are the other things that's some kind of number? Maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning. What is that? I'm not sure I what you mean. Do you know? I think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where there is no time stamp for the numbers. It's Think they say quite a lot of numbers and before that, there's this number. There are numbers in the W tag, but there are no time stamps. But number within the XML context. Are they spoken numbers? Do they look like they're utterances numbers? Yeah. There's the number task, isn't there. That's part of the whole thing. That's at the end. Hmm? That's at the end, her time. Okay. In the beginning as well sometimes, I think. Right. At least I saw some. Maybe. Hmm. Didn't have a look at our meetings. Yeah. We have to probably cut that out anyway for our project, I don't know. It's probably gonna screw up a lot of our data otherwise. Yeah. If Not sure what it does to document It would probably make the if you have segments for that, probably the Okay. Hmm. I think as it occurs it occurs in every meeting. And I think it even has its own annotation, digits or something. So that should be really easy to cut out. I'm just thinking it probably the LSA would perform quite well on it. It would probably find another number task quite easily seeing that it's a constrained vocabulary with a high co-occurrence of the same nine words. Yeah. I'm sure. So that ten word. But what it is it actually that numbers? Hmm? Ah it's just to test the system, I think. Yeah. Okay, but there are no time stamps annotated to that. So Mm they have to read numbers from didn't have a look at that. I think it's also something that they said the numbers in order, right? It's it's quite strange. I think it the it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping and stuff, because basically it's like they're reading them at different speeds, but in which order they are said. Anyway. So They Mm-hmm. ICSI has some reasons for doing it. Hmm. They must have been pissed off saying numbers at the end of every meeting. And also there are different combinations of letters. BRE and something like that. Is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or are they local at any point? Mm I thought they were local to a particular meeting. Okay. Dave, if you would or actually for if you're doing IDFs or you whatever you call your frequencies, always mix up the name, you need some dictionary for that at some point though, like you need to have some representation of a word as not that specific occurrence of that word token, but of of a given word form. Because you're making counts for word forms, right? I'm just building a dictionary. So we should work together on that, because I need a dictionary as well. Mine's just gonna use the hash map one in Java. Cause I'm only gonna do it on small documents. Okay. It's just like until the information density is up and running. Kay. Just something to get give me something to work with. Okay. Didn't you say that the but I'm just wondering for the whole thing. So it's only gonna use quite small documents, see, to start with. Does somebody who was it of you two who said that there's some programme which spits out a dictionary probably with frequencies? It's Rainbow. I think it's just the dictionary in the first place. But no, I have to bin it up and so I will only have counts for each bin or something. Okay. Is anyone of you for the document frequency over total frequency, you gonna have total frequencies of words then with that, right? Over the whole corpus sort of. Or using which tool are you talking about? Why does it need to be classified into different segments? It's because Rainbow is a text classification system. And I think it's not possible to have just one class. That's the problem. Can we just fill a second class with junk that we don't care about? Maybe sure, you sure, we could do that, but that makes sense. I don't know, copies of Shakespeare or something. Cause if what we're looking for is the frequency statistics, I don't see how that would be changed by the classification. If we need just frequencies, maybe we should just calculate them by using Perl or something. The there maybe another tool available? I don't know. It's quite easy to just count or sort them by frequency. Yeah. Just using a Perl script. Be careful with that. My experience with the British National Corpus was that there's far more word types than you ever think because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a new word type. Is it too big? Yeah. Any typo or any strange thing where they put two words together. And also any number as a word type of its own. So you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them. Hmm. So generally dictionaries can grow bigger then you think they do. I don't know how you how many terms you can handle in Perl. You can probably pre-filter with regular expressions just say if it consists of only digits, then skip it, or even if it consists any special characters, then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between, which is usually not something you wanna have and What I did, for my project I just ignored the hundred most frequent words, because they actually end up all being articles and everything and stuff. Mm. I can't remember who's got it. Might be WordNet. But one of these big corpuses has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really uninteresting boring words that we could filter out before we do that. It's that's the papers I read, that's one things they did right at the beginning is they've got this big stop-list and they just ignore all of those throughout the experiment. So several of us need a dictionary. Am I the only one who needs it with frequencies? It would be useful for me as well. Am I the only one who needs it with frequencies? Or Frequencies. I think that'd be useful for me as well. Yeah. Yeah. I guess as soon as we have the raw text, we can probably just start with the Java hash map and just hash map over it and see how far we get. Yeah. We can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte RAM you can go quite far. You can write it on beefy. So even if it goes wrong and even if it has a million words burning it on a we should be able to burn the whole corpus, just the X? All you really wanna do is look into getting some sub-set of the ICSI corpus off the DICE machines. Cause I hate working on DICE. It's awful. So I can use my home machine. Has a CD burner though. Has a CD burner. Ah see, I asked support about that two days ago. In the Informatics building there sorry, in Appleton Tower five the ones closest two machines closest to the support office. So I presume wait, I have the exact email. I think he's talking about sort of the ones that if you enter the big room, in the right-hand corner, I think. Yeah. The right-hand corner, far right. Yeah. The thing is you can only burn from the local file-system. So actually I think if it's mounted, you can directly burn from there, but the problem is I have my data on beefy and so I have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there. But you can burn it from there. How big is it without the WAV files and stuff? We looked that up and we looked that up and I forgot. Cause I could just say at going over SCP one night and just leave it going all night if I had to. No, you we should be able to get it at I don't think it was a gigabyte. The wave data are obviously not gonna get off there completely. Hmm. See I would offer you to get it on this one, and then copy it. But what I figured out, I'm quicker down-loading over broad-band into my computer than using this hard disk. Really? Right? There's something strange about the way how they access the hard disk, how they mount it, which is unfortunate. I'll see if I can SCP it, I suppose. Hmm. What operating system do you have? I've got a Linux box and a Windows box. Okay. So Broad-band. What connection do you have at home? Yeah. So if anyone of us gets it, we can then just use an? Put it on to CD. I can if I get down I can put to CD. Burn it to CD or, put it on hard disk, whatever. Yeah. Question is if you're not quicker because you should get massive compression out of that. Fifty percent or something with a good algorithm. So if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory. I'm not sure if there's enough space. The temp the temps usually have for gigabyte three or two. Is how much do we get? Really? The temps. Okay. There's not guarantee that anything stays there, but overnight it'll stay. And I think the temps usually have. Ah but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can SSH into directory of SSH. But I can do it from that session, can't I? You can compress it from a remote session and SCP it from the same session? They'd they'd probably hate you for doing it. But They'd like you more if you SSH into another computer, compress it there and then sort of copy it into the gateway machine. Do you think? Hey, if you SSH and they have this big warning about doing nothing at all in the gateway machine. Yeah. No no, I was thinking of SSHing just into some machine and then just SCPing it from there. Yeah. To your home machine. Yeah. It has to go through the gateway. I haven't I haven't figured out how to tunnel through the gateway into another machine yet. But Can you not do that? It's not it's not easy definitely. That's why I end up sort of copying stuff into the temp directory at the gateway machine. Mm, I see. Sorry if this is boring everybody else. This is just details and how to get stuff home from what we can probably just look at that together when we're meeting. Yeah. Kay. I just wondered, so who's then doing the frequencies on the words, because I think I could also make use of it for the agreement and disagreement thing. Because I in my outline I talked about using the discourse acts first, and then in the chunks of text I found looking for word patterns and so on. I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. So I would for example need the most frequent words. So if you cut off all that, I. As soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing, I can probably just implement a five line Java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see did you not say frequencies of words in the whole sorry, So you you'd have to count it yourself. I would? But I would like to look at the frequency of words in the regions of text I found out to be interesting. So I wouldn't need it. So you could just But first, how big are the chunks? It it would have to be re-calculated only for my segments. Huh? How big are the chunks you're looking at? Mm. I think it would be, as big as the hot-spot annotation things. So quite small then. That's some utterances. So you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary. Hmm. You just do that on-line 'cause that won't take long to build a little dictionary that big, will it. Just use the same tool that we use. Yes. Yeah. So I would probably just concatenate all my text chunks and then let's say I will run over it. Yeah. You don't wanna have different counts for each chunk, but just sort of for something from old chunks. Yes. No, that's so if I write an algorithm which does a hash table dictionary with frequency from a raw text, then the raw text can be anything. How far are you getting raw text out of it do you think? I can get all the raw text, but it has to be ordered still. So No, it isn't. Okay, that's good, because for the dictionary the order doesn't make a difference, does it? It doesn't need ordered, no. So I'll get that from you and I'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file. So for the dictionary, is it okay if I do, whatever, word blank frequency or something? Just could everybody sort of start from that? I guess I need frequency as well. Are you using TFIDF for the information density? What is implemented in Rainbow is information gain, and I'm not quite sure how they calculate that. Alright, okay. cause frequency would be useful, I think. Yeah. But depending on the context, the size, and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating TFIDF is gonna change. Which might need thinking about. I think we might have a lot in common what we calculate because I for my latent semantic analysis need counts of words within a segment actually, within a topic segment. That's what Rainbow does. I think you can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document. Certain we would have to look at that. Can I convert these probabilities back into frequencies? Okay. So that's what Rainbow does, because that's what LSA builds on. It builds a document by frequency matrix. Mm-hmm. Oh. So I could probably get that. Even though but I already have I already have my code to build it up myself. No, don't bother. I have my code already. So Dave, you said you need the frequency counts actually for per document, would you say, not for the whole thing? I think it would be useful. You need the raw frequency as well. But you also need how many times things occur within each document. And what we consider a document's gonna depend on our context, I think. Cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings, we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm. And if we're viewing say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document. It more and more appears to me that if we scrap the notion of the meeting as an individual thing and sort of see meetings as topic segments and have sort of hierarchical topic segmentation instead, then it's like a more coherent framework. But the thing is It's gonna need some thought of how Actually maybe it doesn't actually matter. Maybe if you just do it once at the highest level, it it will be fine. But I was just thinking it might be difficult to calculate the TFIDF off-line for all the different levels we might want. Cause if we're gonna allow disjoint segments for example, then how are we gonna know what's gonna be in context at any given time? But I suppose if you just did it globally, treating a meeting as a document, it'd probably still be work out fine, because you'd only be comparing to ones within the context. Wait, are we using this for the for the for the weighting in the end now, this measure you're calculating? Don't I thought were you gonna use that in the end? The information density. Because if we're doing for the information density we should calculate it on the lowest level, not on the highest. But 'cause but you have to go sort of in a document versus the whole thing? Sorry, that's what I mean. For each word or whatever, but across the whole lot is by highest level. Across the whole corpus. Isn't that how it works that you look look at I don't think that's a good idea because isn't it like that we expect there to change over with the different topic segments more? But you'd probably look at each meeting as a document. That they talk about something different in each different topic segment. Mm possibly. Cause that's what relative term frequency is about, that like in some context they're talking more about a certain word than in general. So that would more be the the topic segments then. That's what I thought as well, that probably the topic segment level is the most informative for the words. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are they big enough to get anything meaningful out of? That's the problem. I don't know. So I'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings and sort of but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate entity. It's not an issue. But But on algorithmic level, whether we actually whether there's some way to just represent meetings as as topics. You just concatenate an XML file together. But we still want to have a notion of meetings for the user. Yes, definitely. Sure. You just whatever you want to look at, you just jam together into an XML file and that's your meeting, even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever. Hmm. I don't see why that's really a big problem. That's not really what I meant. But I think I have to think more about what I meant. I'm confused about everything. So basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm. It doesn't matter conceptually what that data is. It could be a meeting. It could be two utterances. It could be a meeting plus half a meeting from somewhere else. Yeah. I'm not so concerned about a meeting plus something else, I'm more talking about keeping the same algorithm and the same way of handling it and just saying just this topic here it happens to be a whole meeting and it has sort of sub-topics, so just that sort of topics a hierarchical concept where a topic where there can be super-topics and topics, and the super-topics are in the end what the meetings are, but in general at some level super-topics are treated like topics. I don't think it's very difficult though. What you do is you just build an XML file, and if you want it to get down to the utterances, you'd go to the leaves. And then if you wanted the next level up, you'd go to the parents of those and just go from the leaves inwards towards the branch to build up things like when you click on a segment, it's gonna have words or whatever that are important. Hmm. Mm I'm not really sure what I want. As long as the algorithms are designed with it in mind, I don't think it's a very big problem. So sorry, could describe that again, the Mm-hmm. Say you had say for a meeting, right, you've got say a hierarchy that looks quite big, like this. And the utterances come off of here maybe. Then whatever your algorithm is doing, as long as when you're working with utterances, you go for all the leaves, then if you need something next up, so a topic segment, you'd go to here. Mm-hmm. But if you were looking at say this one, so only went like this. Right, so it's same, you'd start with the leaves, and you go I want a topic segment. So I go one layer up. Mm-hmm. See, and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there, it's the only thing you have to worry about. And each time you want a higher level, you just need to go up the tree. And as long as your algorithm respects that, then we can just process any arbitrary XML file with whatever hierarchical structure we want. So that would be the series as a whole. That would be sort of meetings. A meeting, say, and that would be a topic segment. Yeah. I'm a I'm a I'm a bit brain-damaged at the moment, but I think I'll just sit together with you again and and go through it again. So I think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever structure's in the file, rather than imposing its own structure no, it doesn't have to be. Hmm. So is it is this and this structurally then always identical? That we can treat it with the same algorithm or I'm also not sure how we can go from bottom-up. But it could be as many nodes as you want. This one could be deeper maybe, say. So then you'd start with all your utterances here, and when you go up to get topic segments, you go to here here here here here here. That might be a bit confusing though 'cause you have things on different levels. I have always thought it's more that whatever, I'm a can't think of it at the moment. Probably this is all too complicated worrying about that at that moment anyway. Mm is there anything else we should discuss? Now have we have we decided anything, are we doing anything? Wednesday. Wednesday we are meeting and looking at their at their implementation in some more detail to actually understand what's going on. Yeah. Yeah. So we'll see if we can get a mini-browser just displays two things synched together of some kind. We had two things from their stuff just to make sure that understand it, we understand it enough to modify it. Yeah. Yeah. Should we not have a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing? It'd be useful. I don't know who you see about that though. Hmm. Yep. How would we do that? By just making it read write for everyone. Kay, who has most free space on their Same here. I've gotten mm hardly any. Mm-hmm. I have no idea. I've probably got a reasonable amount because everything on my DICE account can actually be deleted 'cause I store it all at home as well. Alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space. That's where I'm having gigabytes and gigabytes of stuff at the moment. Is that guaranteed to stay, the Maybe you should send a support form. No. No. We can ask Steve if we can get space. Yeah. We could do that. But I think if he sends to the I think if he sends to the port he'd probably be in a better position. Just say we want some web space. Listen to. Yeah. I'm sure he had to deal with that last year. Yeah. Cause that'd be really useful is if we had a big directory. Especially for transferring stuff. Hmm. Having said that, are we allowed to take a copy of the ICSI corpus? Something we should probably ask before we do it. I think he said yes to that. I think that was like when we were still in the seminar room, I asked that once or ask is it possible to get it off and nobody said people were discussing about the technical practicalities, but nobody said anything about being allowed to or not allowed to. Okay. We have access to it here and I guess it probably means that we can't give it to anybody else. But but if they give us access to it here sitting on a DICE machine, then there shouldn't be a reason why we shouldn't be able to use it on our laptop. Okay. I personally don't have too many friends who would be too keen on getting it anyway. No, me neither. Right. I have that really excited pirate copied thing. Jasmine, what is the text you're extracting looking like then at the end? It annotated meeting data. Shall we sit together tomorrow then as well? Okay. Yeah. Would it be best? At the moment it's just lines of Mm-hmm. Because I think it's actually very similar to what I did for my speaker extraction and I think I would perhaps have to change two lines of codes to get you for each meeting a file that says from this millisecond to this millisecond there was this sequence of words. And so on. Okay. So that's just changing two lines of code. And it would give you that. So. So do you extract the raw text, as well? Okay. So far I extracted the durations. But it's from the words file. So I could just concatenate the words instead of the durations, and it should be very straight-forward. Mm-hmm. Print out. I can try to do it and send it to you. Okay. And you have a look at it, will it make sense for what you want. Okay, that Okay. Huh. Have we already extracted from all the files? I just let it run over all the files. Yeah. So Yes. Did you also order Mm-hmm. Wait, wait, wait. I just ordered. Sorry. Sorry. I ordered according to the starting times of the utterances. Hmm. What I just realised, we should really keep different serieses completely separate for virtually all purposes. Just let's be careful about that, because the ICSI corpus isn't one meeting series, it's several meeting series with different people meeting for completely different things. I have one what I give you would be one file for each meeting. Hmm. For each meeting. Not for each meeting series. Alright. Okay, but let's just be careful that whatever we merge together, that the highest level of merging, it's not the whole ICSI corpus but individual series. I didn't do that yet. One group. Hmm. Might be funny to see what is summarised the whole corpus as anyway. Actually I think That's probably be somewhere or something like it. I think it'd be very useful. But We can just change the code. I think we might just get away for the whole project just like looking at only one series and just doing within one series. You can do everything you want in one series. There's one series that has just one meeting. Let's take that. That sounds good. Is the is the data always clearly split up by different series? Is it easy to just pick one Okay. Yes. You you the data is of the form you have three identification letter. So BED or BBD or something, and that's always the same group. Okay. Okay. And then after that there's a number like OO one, OO two. But that's really quite easy to see because they're named. Okay. So at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level, just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just majorly messy. Hmm. So so even if we make one single text file which has the whole corpus, sort of our corpus, that would still be from one series only. But what you're producing at the moment is individual text files that sort of have the raw text for a meeting as a whole or Mm-hmm. Yes. But I mean as the start times start for each meeting at zero, you could just probably just add the final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together. But then we would have to change the information about who on which channel it was set, by which person it was set. Yeah. And that is actually stored in another XML document. Hmm. Kay. So is anybody creating a real raw text thing at the moment, which is just the words? That's what I'm gonna need. cause that's what I'm gonna need as well. I would then just not print out the start and end times. Yes. It's just changing it a bit. But if there aren't so it's start and end times just for the file. Okay. Is it just the first and the last line? Or is it for every single thing in So what do you mean by just not print out that? No, it's for every single word. Or for every single utterance. That depends on what you want. Yeah. But I do it with Perl, it's just string manipulation. So I would just Sure. Okay. If you're into it, can you make a text file which just makes just the words? Kay. Do you want it straight flowing, 'cause I would need something that marks the end of is yours segmented by topics then that is there any information that you have to the automated topic topic segmentation? No, I didn't do a no. Then I need something different later anyway. Okay, but for now, if you Okay. No, but that's what MLC seg does. It it marks the end of each segment. You're gonna put that as an output of yours, the segmentation. Yeah. Okay, so for now can you create sort of just a dump which is just pure text so that I can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation. Yeah. And Or for for the series. And you would want that all in one file for all the corpus? Or For the series. But I can also deal with separate files, I can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something. If you But if you can put it in one single mega-file, that would be quite useful for me. I can directly put it into just So only words per meeting series. Oh. Even though for you, wouldn't it be easier if you had different files because then you sort of know. Yeah. For me it's better if they're by meeting. So give me different files as long as it if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them, like whatever, one two three four five or something. Uh-huh. Yes. Or just anything that I can. I will just take I would take over the names they have anyway. Is it something that's easily to enumerate over? Is it some just some ordered pattern? Okay, cool. One series has the same three starting letters. So So only words and words and times. Okay, cool. Yeah. And you want it ordered. I don't need the times, I just need the words. But in the right order. In the right order. Yes. Okay. It's just a wish list. Okay, anybody ord base dot times. Orders. And sometimes they're contained in one another. So Just after mm-hmm. That doesn't matter too much, I think. Kay. Ordered. Only words. When do you think you'll have a primitive segmentation by some ready-made topic segmentation by some ready-made tool ready? Then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text. It's just a case of running the script. Okay. Okay, cool. Cause I'll need that then when it's done. Hopefully this week. Okay. And I think for all the corpus, I know from other times, it's nine byte to have should be similar to have the words. Mm-hmm. Is that it? That's quite good. Should be. What's what's nine megabyte? The the That sounds quite reasonable. All the words together for all the meetings. Alright. That's nine characters over okay. That's what I because nine mega-byte is what I got for when I said for every utterance, this goes from there to there and takes seconds. Okay. Okay. That is for are we are we picking one particular series at the moment? Or Yes. And we could Don't know. Oh. I'm doing it for all of it. Doesn't matter. Okay. Yeah. I guess we can probably process the data for all different series and then check which series is the best for the presentation. Yeah. It sounds quite reasonable, nine megabyte. If you think if it's roughly a million words and nine characters per word sounds. I hope it will be the same for the words. It's just what I Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm gonna build a dictionary then from that. Just maybe a list of the words with the frequencies or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically. What what does anyone want? Does this there any wishes for dictionaries? I could just use it with the frequency, until the information density thing's finished. That would be really useful. Hmm. Mm. So I'll create a dictionary. So I will probably send just one file of the first meeting to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want. Add the structure. Mm-hmm. And then the actual file we can probably copy from your home directory or something like it. If it's just for one meeting, it's really not too big. But I'm saying for the whole thing in the end. Then the big thing we probably shouldn't do by email. Yeah. Yeah. How long would it take to make the frequency counts with a Java hash table? From the time I get the file I can do that in an afternoon, sort of the next morning. Yeah. You mean how long processing time it takes. No, how long you would have to program something. Ah, it's a bog standard algorithm. I've I've sort of I've written it for for DIL just in half an hour or something similar. Okay. It's just you put them in a hash table and say if it exists already in the hash table then you increase the count by one and I'll probably implement some filter for filtering out numbers or something. Mm. Because it's quite easy in Perl as well, it's just a line of code for counting all the words and it's by hashes. Really? How do you do that? Okay, I don't know any Perl. Yeah. If anyone wants to do a Perl script for that that does it nicely, I've no problem with that. Yeah. I but I think I have the Java code virtually ready because for DIL I wrote something very similar. Kay. For DIL I wrote something that counts the different occurrences of all the tags Sorry? If you're doing it in Java, could you serialize the output as well as writing it to a file? If you're doing it in Java, could you serialize the dictionary, as well as writing it to a file? The hash table? I've never serialized anything. It's really easy. Wouldn't that be absolutely massive though? I don't see why it'd be any more massive than the file. And then and then write the serialization to a file. Yeah. So you want a file which is the serialization of a hash table. It just saves you parsing the file representation of it. Okay. And now 'cause I would be using it in Java anyway. So I'd just be building the data structure again. Yeah. I I'll I'll check if I understand how it works. Otherwise I can give you the code for loading a dictionary. Give you my it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file. But it seems like a bit silly to be parsing it over and over again kinda thing. Yeah. I'll see if I understand how to serialize. There's a serialise command so that gives me one mega mother of a but do they automatically write to the file anyway I'll figure that out. I would've thought that I think all the collections and things implement serializable already. I think they might do. We don't have to Yes, is that pretty much it? So Dave and me look at how NITE XML works and we're. Tonight I'll try and I'll either work some more on the TFIDF summarizer or do the audio thing. I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text. So that When do we have to meet again then with this? Suppose we're just getting on with all our components. Yeah. So I know. How are we gonna do a demonstrator next week? My God. Do we have to demonstrate something next week? Yeah. What do we have to demonstrate? No no, not demonstrate, but didn't you say that didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of it, like some primitive thing working next week. He suggested that we could have an initial prototype. That's gotta be very prototype. I know, I'd I'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Ah let's go. Sorry. Alright. I feel like hanging mid-air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working properly and so it's all so fuzzy the whole but at the moment but at the moment it's also an implementational level. I know. I think it's 'cause we had to specify it ourselves that it's not as focus the specification of most work we have to do. With the data structures, I'm just over these vague ideas of some trees, I'm. Yeah. Once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious anyway. It's just we are half-way through the project time table. That's just what freaks me out.",
