    "displayText": "Okay everybody is ready? Good morning again. So, today we are going to have a second meeting. Michael, hi. Yep. You're late. You have a good reason for that? Yes. Very good. Okay, let's have a look to the agenda today. So, we are going to have a meeting about the functional design. So first before starting I just going to go quickly through the minutes of previous meeting. So basically we are not decided if we should go for a universal or specific remote control, but I have new inputs about that topics. I I'm going to share with you. And basically we decided to go to individual actions for each of you so Industrial Designer was supposed to work on on the working design. Yep. You showed us you you you prepare something for us? Yeah. Yep. The UI guy also work on that, and for our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs. Mm. Alright so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations. But first I would like quickly to decide to give a name to the project. So, I just put quickly Remo, but if you have any other names that we could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly. Any ideas? Mm-hmm. The Powerstick. Powerstick. What else? What else? Uh. Maybe a Spanish name would work well. Mm I was thinking of the Mando. Especially if we're selling into the US market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there. Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish. Mando. What is that? Mango? Mango? Mando. Mando. MA? MA? AN DO. M DO. Mm, okay. It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me, but maybe for a Spanish for I for Control. What does it mean? Oh. What does it mean in Spanish? Control. Hmm. Okay. Nice. Cause it also in English it sounds like the man's tool because men like to have control of the remote so it might The Mando. But mm. Mando sounds Latino. Okay. So, let's go for Mando? Yeah? No objection? That's. Great. And you could have the fonts special, so you have man in in one in one font and then the O as Although you don't wanna cut women out of the potential buyers though, do you? So Okay, I think this is Okay. So. They are the most TV watcher. So we should be careful. Okay, of I think this is more a question of look and feel. But it because if the product will be international Maybe I should start. Marketing. Something that should be addressed later. We should we should go to other for the other topics. That's the thing. We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a. Okay, so let's stick to Mando for the name and we'll see for the look and feel later. So let's go for the three presentations right now. So, who want to start? So maybe we could start with the market. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay so I have your slides somewhere? Yeah. Should be in participant four. Participant four. This one? Uh. That's coming. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Great. Okay so I will give a brief outline about what I prepared for this meeting. Mm-hmm. For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements. I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls. And also I I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five, ten years. There is no significant difference between the the first new controls and. Okay. Next slide? Okay. Yeah. More most of the people think that remote controls are ugly, thoroughly. And they admit that they would spend more money in a fancier remote control, which is good and it's interesting point. Also the people are worried about about the RSI disease, which is if you repeat the the same movement, which is not a with a not very appropriate device, you you will have problems when you will get old. So people are worried about the shape of the remote control. They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often, so I think it would be a good point to to to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost. Mm-hmm. And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control. Okay. So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is, the more like the the liklier it is to get lost. Liklier or more likely? More likely. Likely. Okay. People also complain because they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons which are not very use memorising channels or this kind of actions which are not very often but they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the remote in the remote control. Also the the design should fit the hand shape. So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes, for right and left handed people. The thing is though, most remote controls are used by more than one person. So unless you're kind of targeting single people you're gonna maybe cut out a lot of your market. Yeah. Dunno I Anyway I think it could be interesting to release a a small fraction of this remote controls. Maybe it could be a universal design. Sorry? A universal design, which is which is good for both the hands. Yeah. Still shaped for your hand but not for a particular hand, right? Yeah? That's right, whether it's left hand or right hand, but but don't you think that the two points are clashing, one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small? Yeah. Sorry? The first and the third point, they are clashing. You can still extend past the hand. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No no I was thinking of something. Uh. So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then. It means like, this remote here kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you might have it kind of a bit bigger with maybe some finger molds or something. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones? Little sleek, longer? And it should fit the hand. Something with the shape of the palm? Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Some finger grips maybe. Yeah. You could even have some buttons on the sides and everything, but. On the sides. It it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetrical. Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Not anymore. That's what. And then finally. And finally, the incorporation of a LCD or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting, but I don't know if the budget would be large enough. First I'm just wondering about the LCD stuff because so maybe it's a good time for me to bring you to some new informations. But most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology. We had the new requirements so from the head offices of the company, and so so they want to they would like to be restricted to TV. Yeah. Okay, I dunno if you had this information already. No. No, so they want us to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations. They want also Excellent. Actually this marketing report is restricted to TV remote controls. So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because teletext is outdated now and finally, it should be clear that the corporate image, that means colours and logos of our company should be clearly identified in the product. So. I was still working on this twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there, this is quite a low price if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though, but. Sure sure. So maybe we can jump to your presentations, right now. Yep. Okay. Okay so let's keep in mind about that this last point about LCD and speech Sorry, what is your? Yeah. I think even if it was within budget do a speech system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching TV you're gonna have a lot of this background noise from the TV which might interfere with the participant three. You might have some background noise from the TV which will make the speech recognition much harder, so. But you should be able to activate or disactivate, so. You press a button to talk, and the TV the TV sound turns off. Channel fifty. Yeah. No it could be command control kind of thing. It recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated. Means you should say does that, remote control being on or be on kind of thing, and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition. Yeah. Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the TV also. Yeah. So there should be something command controlled, you start and then you stop. Mm. Yeah. It's like VI editor, you are having two modes similarly. Otherwise it's just lying idle. Okay Michael. Okay, so, could I describe the mouse maybe be easier I use the mouse, or Mm. Sorry? Thanks. Okay. The wheel doesn't work. Great. Okay so while researching this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote, and just looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes, and then also searched for which are the top-rated remote controls on Epinions dot com, which is a a a customer written basically review site. So there's a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and this remote control right here is one of the more extravagant, but it's by no means mm on it's own in being so expensive. There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there. Looks like a PDA? So it's basically all the functions are controlled through the LCD screen except for the really really kind of main functions, which have a couple of their own buttons. And if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the. But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, and it's kind of difficult to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it, which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel, which I think it's a really kind of important design aspect it's 'Cause the thing is what we the this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do. And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel. Change the channels. Yeah. Now I think that a scroll wheel is actually a pretty handy way of changing the channel. Cause I know when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the pad. Mmm-hmm mm-hmm. I usually use the up and down because most channels are two digit numbers and you have to press a special button to enter a two-digit number, and then two numbers, so it's annoying. So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy. Now the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an LCD screen, and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability. Mm-hmm. One possibility, if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Euro, but one possibility is to download program information into the LCD screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on, often you don't know what channel it's on, or you don't know what's on. If you have a list of of programs on your LCD screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel. So if you think about it's kind of in mobile phones now you don't remember people's phone number, you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it. So this would be kind of a handy thing to have, but we really need to discuss the price. So, there are cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's very simple, there's only a few buttons, but each of those buttons does something different in a different context. So this is something else we might wanna consider, is really kind of limiting the number of buttons, because this is the top rating universal remote control on Epinions. It's really maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control. And was saying before about having different size buttons for different frequently used tasks, but I think also the location and shape of the buttons is important, but also the number of buttons. So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want. But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality. So we we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we're only doing a television remote control. Mm-hmm. Because the same button is doing too many things. I think maybe one option is to have a little flip-open door that you have hidden most of the time, but contains the extra buttons say, the number buttons for instance. Mm-hmm. I would if I had my perfect remote control, I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way. Mm-hmm. They don't really do anything. Maybe I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever, maybe a door that you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good. Mm-hmm. But I think definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum, but not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of the device. I guess that depends on how you market it. I think that the transition to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because if people see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional If I'm sure if you can sell a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyone will buy it. It does sampling out of the. If you have the right advertisement showing how how easy it is and how you can, navigate to a program without the numbers, then people might say that looks pretty easy. Okay, can you continue, please? But yep. Okay, so, I think one of the really kind of useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number. So if we can have a higher priced remote control I think that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing. Mm there's the LCD screen, which maybe maybe is too expensive, but I think also at the scroll wheel, haven't mentioned it here, the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen, just for changing channel numbers easily. I think that, would be a fairly cheap thing, compared to an LCD screen, to implement, but I think that would be quite useful as well. Mm-hmm. And the other thing, you say we need to keep it just television, but I think maybe one option, since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device, is there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can have with technology, and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks. Say you have another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can, say change the lighting in the room. That would be something maybe you could sell as an extra, so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development, but, later on you can you also, selling the potential of the device. Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights, dunno, close the windows, whatever, turn the heating on, I think that's something we may need to have as at least as an optional extra to kinda make our product cool, since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics. Okay. Okay. Okay, thanks. Yep. You want to go? So. So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition that means on my own it should be. This one? Great. No, not that one. You are two. Two. Alright. Okay so the working design is user interface could be of two types, one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing he is knowing about that technology. So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this, and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes, it can be useful for them, and the new users, as our Marketing Expert was saying, they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing. Okay, sorry to interrupt you, but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel. That's right. So anyway, that didn't come into my mind, so that is a possibility. Okay. These could be other kind of interfaces. Means we can have, depending on the cost, how much we can afford, we can have different kind of interfaces. So buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with. So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is, and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking. Mm-hmm. Otherwise we are just like others in the market. So anyway that is the first, user interface could be of more than one type, and that means we can do the on-line changes which cannot be done now actually. So apart from the speech, we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons. Now for buttons, normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required. And for voice, limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote. Yeah. That increases the the cost also. That's right. But means we have to see what kind of microphones and stuff like that. Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough? Yes, if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough. Okay. We can target, means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven That's right. I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into the remote control. Hmm. No it could be little it could be That's right. So it could be a few centimetres. One other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets, though, because, I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this, but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries. That's right. Yeah. So then you have to train models for. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. It's more like, means there are different speech technologies which are existing so DTW could be kind of which is the easiest. So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself, and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is, instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller. Okay. Okay we should discuss this later after after this slide. That's right. Yeah. So we That's right. This is a this is a very important issue in discussion. Yep. Okay, next. Yep. That finished? No no. Components. No? Components? Yeah. So, will you go to the next slide? Yes sure. So this is the design which we are thinking so. We are having a power button and the switch, which is not much, and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not. And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time. So we could not put that. So now where the ASR decoder is sitting, similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there. So there is ASR decoder which could be there, and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller, and then there could be buttons, and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the put it in the proper message format. And then there is there is the chip which is sitting, the green one, and it converts it into bit codes, and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver. Okay. So this is the easiest design there could be. So an ASR decoder we can have things in. To have different technologies. So this was the my personal preference was that we can have ASR sitting there on the remote control. I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying turn volume up, and you press the button like people teach sign language to kids by speaking and doing. Yeah. But as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up. So these are the slight problems. Okay. So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies? Because the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea, but the Marketing Expert presentation was So if we go with just the Mm-hmm. Actually I'm not so sure because if I was using a remote control to, say, turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well, I don't really want to drown out what people are saying by talking when I'm instead of pressing up on a remote control. I'm sure. If there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear, I'm trying to actually find out what's being said, so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps. Yeah. Okay so Okay gentlemens, we have to take some decisions right now. But the average frequency of pushing buttons, it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour, or something like that. It depends Maybe if the remote control is something that you don't actually have to pick up anymore, that would be a useful feature of the speech recogntion. If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it, then that could be. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. So if I kind of summarise everything we we said. We are targeting TV. We need to have remote control which is easy to not too small, not too big. We have or good shape, yes. With a good shape for the. We should bring new technologies for young peoples, as we have also requirements to use to to push toward the internet. Maybe this is something we can stick to it. And also, a very interesting things I I've seen on on the one of our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate. So my feeling is that regarding costs budget have an an an target price, it's not possible to go to go to LCD and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. First why not to go to LCD. Because in fact as we are targeting TV in fact we can use TV screen as a screen some feedback informations about what we could have. It depends though it depends. If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the TV or we have control over the TV then we can't actually display that. If we produce the TVs then we can put menus up there, but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the TV to superimpose those menus. So that's an extra cost. That's right. Don't we have contacts with people on TV or systems that exist that we can use? This is another we still haven't really defined the remote. Are we still you say we're focusing on TV, but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control, or is this something for our own line of of televisions? Yeah. Cause that really makes a big difference. Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' TVs. It's just there are too many TVs out there. Yeah. It's it's not really gonna For twenty five Euro? That's good point. What could be the cost of could we fit the targets in terms of cost if we go to LCD on the remote control? Yeah. It's not possible. I think it's impossible. It's impossible. But I dunno, I think it would be good to know if there is any leverage in any leeway in that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control, and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is putting the fashion into electronics. So I would like to know if there's any chance of increasing the of increasing the unit price. But what would be one question, what would be the goal of putting an LCD in a remote control? So we should target something maybe which would be more expensive but really fancy in terms to had to have really an added value? Yeah. Yeah. Because. Okay, so regarding the automatic speech recognition, I think They have teletext. Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers, like an interactive programme guide. What what kind of information? But most of the TVs nowadays show the show the but most of the TVs have teletext nowadays. Because they have teletext on it. You have a teletext signal that you can that you can get through the channel. Most of them have teletext, but we want to get rid one of our requirements is to move to teletext to the use of internet. Yeah. So to to browse more easily the teletext. You can get a lot more information on it. For instance through your remote control. So what would what would appear in the in the LCD? So you could have the start time where it's up to. The start time, all the programmes you could have I don't know if this information is available from teletext, also. You could have even a little image of the the the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading no, but there are the electronic programme guides out there. Okay. Are But just a small thing, what kind of market we are targeting? They may not have pictures, but maybe they do. There's it also depends on the country. Because for the same reason that we cannot informations on the TV. We we couldn't grab information information which is not there. No but with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from. So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that. So that mean we need an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse, in addition to the TV, or it should be a special TV connected to Okay. But. Uh. I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because I don't think you could even get teletext information from the TV onto the remote control, especially if we don't control the TV. I dunno. We need to find that out. We need to close the meeting. So Very quickly. Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market, or what? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of LCD thing could be as high as the TV itself. That is very important. No. Mm. If it's a really small TV maybe. People go to buy another remote control when they broke their, and they want to go for universal one, and they take the fanciest they can have. Broke. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is that we that that we should target. So the the the committment is the following, we don't go for speech recognition technology. Mm-hmm. The LCD is still on is still open to discussion. It is up to you to go through this way and to report me back next meeting. But not sure. I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the LCD. It's it's cheaper as compared to the LCD. Maybe it's cheaper, but no Okay this is an open question for you. Because with the LCD you need more requirements. You need a internet connection. You need more things. But for the speech recognition you you don't need anything. The thing is I think the type of I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have a wireless internet connection maybe, or a. You just say channel fifty, and that's it. But then we should move to another target because at twenty five Dollars, it's To move to another target? Means twenty five Euros is that's right. This is what we need to find out. Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control? Cause otherwise we need It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna Ninety five percent is not good enough though. Yeah. This is up to you to tell us. But to no no no, I'm I'm definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies. I'm not confident enough. I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work. That work It's. How to guarantee such performances is really hard. The expert said ninety five percent. This is very bad. So, this is the end of this discussion. Next meeting here are the task you have to work on. So you have to work on the component concept. Okay. You have to work on user interface, and you have to go through a trend watching. Okay. So the question is still open about the LCD thing. I hope that next meeting we'll take some decision that direction. Thanks. Yep. Bye.",
