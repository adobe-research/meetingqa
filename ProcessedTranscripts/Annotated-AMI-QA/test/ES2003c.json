    "displayText": "Alright. Crack on. Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. I think to sum up the last meeting, would be to say the requirements that we've set out. We were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick, LCD and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. We were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck, the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck. That pretty much sums up the last one. So we'll just crack on, to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible. Okay. The today is the today. I have a presentation I just saved it in the folder. This meeting is the conceptual design phase and is Sorry about this. And is to cover things like what the parts might be made of, can we outsource these from elsewhere, will we have to construct any items ourselves? Okay I'll load it up then. Um. Which one do interface concept? Uh. That's me. Uh. That's you. We've got trend watching, that's you. It's Components design. Components design. Okay. Alright. So. The case that's what I wrote first of all, could be our plastic. But later on we found out that it can be rubber as well, or titanium or even wood. So we decide what it's gonna be. Probably plastic. We need the infra-red transmitter. Get that off the shelf. Joystick probably if we're gonna use it, could be plastic or rubber even as well. If you go on to the next slide. If you go on to findings, it's two or three slides down. Right. Okay. So, this is what I found we can use. Three different types of batteries. Can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, that they use in watches, or else a solar powered one. Okay. Um. Now, the kinetic one, we've 'cause that's the ones where the movement causes it. Cost is. Yeah. The battery for a watch wouldn't require a lot of power, would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? Mm. There's also a watch moves around a great deal more. Do you think? Uh. Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again, you'd say? I don't think it would. Yeah. Um. And solar cells, I dunno about that. Yeah. Uh. We should probably just use conventional batteries. Just in usual remote controls. Um. Yeah. Um. And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. One is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. The materials are there as you can see, but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved, which would be and light. Titanium, the really strong metal, titanium? Is it not also it's expensive? Think so as well. They make mountain bikes out of that, don't they. Um. Um. So it's really light as well. Curious. I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not, the single curved and double curved, would you be able to give an example? Um. Could you maybe draw something? Yeah. You doesn't have to be perfect, it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two. Uh. For a curved, I was thinking for to sit in the palm of your hand. Maybe like this, with the joy pad here. Joystick here. And maybe an okay button around here, so that the thumb can use it quite easily. I don't exactly Double curved. It probably means this is probably double curved. Whereas a single curved would be like that. I guess. Or not necessarily. So it might literally just be okay. Two curves. Like that. Whereas this is two curves. So I guess that's what they mean by double curve. Alright. Which obviously it looks better than the single curve, but you can't have it in titanium, which is a nice material. Mm. And for the buttons, it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for PCs. But it requires a more expensive chip to use, and if you wanna use LCD it's even more expensive. So you have to decide, there's trade-offs there. If you have a double curve control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. But I reckon you're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days. You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want. You wanna enter just the number of it, if you know it. So I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway. Do you think? Okay, that was definitely something we can talk about. So you've got a little bit about the chip that we might require as well? Yeah. So, depends where gonna spend the money if you want the fancy LCD display. Do you have any idea so far, like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an LCD, does that shoot the cost up by a drastic amount? Or? Need an advanced chip for the LCD. Did I Advanced, three eight six advance. I think compared to say just pressing buttons. Yep. If you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red, whereas I think if we're controlling the LCD we definitely require a much more powerful chip. Okay. Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons is the point being made. Okay, sure. Mm. If I've not over-stepped. Yeah? The previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the remote control. Okay, should I go on, or go back? Mm, if we only have twelve Pounds fifty, twelve Euros, not even twelve Pounds. Twelve Euros, what's that, eight pounds or something like that, nine Pounds? We'd also be relying on the bulk buying in producement and such. Okay, that's good point. I assume. We have to look into the costs of those. Sorry. If you go to the one before that it just says what it does, translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the TV. The chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then it'll send it to the amplifier. Okay. And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the rubber buttons, to get sent to the chip. So that's just how the control works inside. We have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use. Okay. Um. So in the information that you've been supplied, how feasible would you say that the idea of using an LCD looks? I think we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic. And then maybe use single curved case. Because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joystick easily. And then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the LCD. That sounds like quite a good requirement to me. Conventional battery would seem to make sense. I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I don't know about anybody else, but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward? Mm-hmm. Mm. I'm actually gonna be bold and go straight for rubber for reasons I'll go in more detail. Okay. I also have a preference for rubber. Okay, will we move on to user interface, and? Based on my research. Sorry, as long as were you? Mm. Yep I'm finished. Yeah. Okay. And interface concept. Yep. Now I'm gonna have to work between the slides and the white board 'cause actually I have some fairly concrete things this time. Yeah. I was given an HTML file giving various ideas from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all. I wasn't very impressed by them and nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. So rather than looking at other remotes, be better to simply look at the human hand. And try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on, so that if so that each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. So next slide, if you please. And what we've basically decided on was the the the joystick, two function buttons and the LCD, just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum. I don't actually think we need the numeric keypad because because one of the menus that we could have available via the LCD is one where you scroll through channels, so if there's something and bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for digital or for or for cable, whatever, you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels, and then your VC and then the channel through your VCR or DVD player. Digital. Ah, okay. Or box. So it's not I'm not really excessively concerned about that. You must have two basic mode, where the joystick's left right left right for channels, up down for volume, and the menu mode for further functions. Now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. So Mm-hmm. Can I just jump in slightly there? That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate, then. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Basically what be having I would say, the whole thing articulated at two points, so that if you're handing it from a left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the LC the LCD and the joystick would be in the right place. And also this is a rather nicer design gimmick that the the whole thing it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be, soft to touch and can be moved around all nice. Mm. Okay on to the next slide. Okay. Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well, because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say, I guess. Okay. kay basically I can add pretty pictures to this. Assuming the hand to be in about sort of this position, holding the remote, the joystick unit should rest over the joint of the four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb. And there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users. So. You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness. You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part, one for the four finger, one for the middle finger. And this part here is the joystick. Is this the joystick? This would be the actual grip. Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well. Okay. That would be probably the bulkiest part. And you then have, at the bottom, the LCD, and this would need to be articulated as well. And basically I'd want this to rest here, right at the base of the wrist. So it would fit just nicely in the hand. And again, this part could be rotated, so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user. So the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button. And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes. Now programming it actually this is one thing I've found with the replacement remote control. Programming them can be a right pain. So I thought the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could program it in a rather more comfortable interface. And you could download programs for it for TVs from all sort of main manufacturers. Though it would be necessary to have a have a mode for programming it without the computer, just in case there are still people left out there who don't have them yet. Mm. Um. But. Yeah. Okay. That's that's my idea. Excellent, right. Mm. Kay. File open. We go. Trend watching. Okay. So to gather my research, two basic methods. We compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. And then we research fashion trends in Europe, what's the new black, as it goes. Next slide please. Okay. We found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to be cool. As in they want it to do a lot of good they want it to look like it does a lot, and if it does do a lot that's a bonus, but they don't care so much. They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction. Technology technical technologically innovative. People want it to be that, but still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. So the interface is really important. And easy to use, it it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important the second point is twice as important as the third point. People want it it has to be cooler than easy to use, if it has the newest features, even if it's difficult to use, prefer it to have the newest features. And if it's easy to use that's a bonus. The fashion, now this seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and veg is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. How that relates to a remote control I don't know. But I I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide. Spongy. I've I've been saying everything's the new black. Spongy's the new black as well. So we have the choice between rubber and plastic. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, it's spongy, then can I skip the rest? I forgot to mention that. The rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. Okay. Okay, so kinda spongy material. Forgot to say that. So my personal opinion? Okay. We want something fancy and technologically innovative, obviously. But what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool, that's different, everyone has a white remote control, black remote control, you need something cool. Titanium is cool but it's expensive. And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control. Now the fruit and veg options, either we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. The research did come up with fruit and veg, so maybe it's the up to the interface guy. So if we stay away from it, stay away from it, but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit. It could be something like, I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do. So I think cool is the key. Few questions about a spongy remote control. I've never seen one before. I've seen plastic remote controls. I think maybe don't back in the day when they first came up with remote controls, they had a reason for it being sturdy. Mm-hmm. For being strong and sturdy. So if we want something strong and sturdy, say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, it doesn't matter, it's spongy material, it's not gonna break. I just don't know how the LED and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable. So how do things fit it? And if we are gonna use spongy, we can say it's damage resistant and stuff like that, so. So just to summarise, people want stuff that looks like it's cool, and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be people like fruit and veg. We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it. People like spongy material. If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is, and how we can further promote that idea. And also, this was this year. So, things change all the time, every year they always talk about this year, this is the new black. Next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff. Mm-hmm. Kay. Okay. That's me. I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs, so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway. Mm-hmm. Um. Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf, so I don't exactly what cost would be incurred. I can see your point about the number keypad, but I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels. Yeah. Mm-hmm. My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of boxes as well having the use of the LCD and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be Mm-hmm. Actually if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, it's if you're trying to remember what number's the discovery channel or whatever. It's just irritating. That's a good point. You can incorporate names into the menu. But if you but but but if you have a but if you have a menu structure, then you can sub-group them. Okay. So you. Even news, music. Okay. Like they do on sky digital kinda. Yeah. So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components, say something like lithium ion battery, the kind that you find in most small hand held devices now. Looks like we going for a double curved design. I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. I would say definitely, I mean the idea of having it sort of articulated there would be basically two points of articulation. One below and one above the the main sort of grip. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? So Mm. I can see why it looks appealing, but it could be a weak point in the structure, do you think? That would be a worry of mine. If you're going with the fruit and veg thing, looks like a banana. If you wanna design it that way. I don't I don't think that it would be a structural weakness, if you have a firm sub-structure, you can then incorporate articulation into that. If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is very much organic, and would look rather cool. My drawing there doesn't do it justice, it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a remote control, but. We won't add that functionality. Okay. Course not. However, one interesting point is, I don't know how serious you were there, but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the the colour of the logo? Yeah. Sure. Okay. I dunno. It's certainly a different colour from your average That's true. Mm-hmm. Make it harder to lose, as well. Yeah. Sure. Was there anything in your research Mm-hmm. The noise for when you lose the banana, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep beep. The banana, you lose the banana, you press a button, and you hear monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. Monkey. I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable, though maybe have monkey as default. I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Um. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all TVs, you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. Mm-hmm. But why you'd need to program it as a standard feature, I don't know. Basically for each manufacturer will have a particular command set that the TV responds to. It's not simply a matter of frequency. Yeah. So usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the remote, and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's because televisions, they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it. That's right. Okay. So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that. But if we had some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the LCD and then they maybe look up different names of different actual units that have been produced. Yeah. Yeah. Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's does this do the correct function, and such. Is it actually a book of names to digits, or is it a few pages? Booklet. Some pages. I was just thinking, if we were to store this information, some type of mapping. This person probably need to use this feature once, when you first buy the remote control, or whenever they buy a new television, so once every and it's Mm. Yeah. Doesn't have to be used very often that's right. Yeah. But it's a but it's a nuisance. And it's a nuisance very close to actually purchasing it, so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about. If you if there's if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance, you might be favourably inclined towards it. Mm. Mm. Okay, this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage. Mm. I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway. This is the conceptual one. Um. I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here. I think we've decided on standard items for most of rubber and such, so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting. So for example, I'll just start at the top, you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to, obviously. Looking from prototyping of some description using clay. I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as progress. The user interface design, it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there, whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the LCD's going to incorporate, do you think? Or do you perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout? Mm. I think other than getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it, most of the sort of layout design decisions are made, would say. But then again, the menu structure to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television, and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate. And one of the nice things about having an LCD and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it. Mm-hmm, that's very true. Um. Okay. Got product evaluation as well. See some of these things kinda logically follow the others. Um. How can product evaluation, doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. I think no, it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with. That's the okay, sure sure sure. So it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out, maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar. Mm-hmm. Or just kind of hitting the streets and saying this is a new remote control, what do you think of the look of it? Okay, sure. I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous. At this stage we still have no no target audience or 'Kay. The reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a replacement remote control, something that's stylish, so maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then, they've got a bit of free cash, so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket. And it's stylish. Mm-hmm. Maybe even single, just for the reasons of excess cash flow. Mm. Although of course at twenty five Euros, I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the device. Yep. Yeah. Think that's within the normal bracket. Okay. Your idea of the USB would largely depend on the cost. USB's definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there, but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system. That one might have to be based on The idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the PC for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice, easy minimal design, normally. Programmable memory as well. The USB for which? For the remote control. Right, okay. We've definitely talking some type of Different. Um. But didn't they just say it's just for TV, or are we gonna Okay. It's just for TV, but for programming it to use your TV, you might hook it up to the PC. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the USB might be prohibitive. Mm. We don't know unless it would make sense to. But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something. It's. Something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed, once you turn off the power. Yeah. The other thing it would need to it would need to have some sort of on board memory anyway. Yeah. For one thing because I do think that the menu system should be although it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device, the menu system ought to be customisable and Mm-hmm. Different languages, different skins and stuff like that. Mm-hmm. It would make sense to. How how you want say the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels. Sure. If it was customisable as in different languages and stuff, that does open it is supposed to be international, right? That sort of thing. So. It would make sense if you could Okay. I would say to. And we'd better be careful about the time as well. We've already had the five minute warning, so. Um. I would say. International would make sense. You're gonna look at product evaluation. I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap. You're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say. Looks like we're gonna need maybe a kind of prototype in clay. Yeah. We'll see how that goes. Um. Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know. Where is the clay? So do I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting, would you say? Yeah. Mm-hmm. They're going with the fashion thing, like the design, spongy rubber. The fruit and veg. This one. Yeah. Mm. That would be my feeling. I I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing. But the spongy idea I like. I like it a lot. We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the rubber could be quite. Yeah. Yeah. I having it having it sort of bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea, though maybe we could have options for colours as well. Yeah. And again this has the advantage of being harder to lose. Sure. We are trying to promote a remote control, but we wanna keep the company brand as well, so. Mm-hmm. So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. Mm. Yeah. Um. I was like I said before I think we should have the RR on the top function button. Okay. And I think that says it all really. I think so too. Right. See everybody in a half hour.",
