If you dump it in there. What's your username? Your username. What's your username and password? Mm-hmm. Sorry. Okay. Okay. There we go. Excellent. Right. Hopefully that's us ready to go. So. Functional design meeting. We'll have to flesh out some of the stuff. We'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. Not a lot thankfully to say. We introduced ourselves, discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interacting the TV a bit more, mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, and ergonomics of the remote control as well. It's come to my attention the following. Teletext has become outdated due to the popularity of the internet. Remote control should only be used for the TV. Due for time to market and possibly also cost issues. Also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. Um. Now. Just to say quickly I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. Mm. Or its functionality would have been of limited use. So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. If anybody disagrees we can definitely say so. And hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going. I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first, to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go. Kay. So I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want. Sure. I'll just do it from here. Yep. Sorry. Uh. Is yours the sorry. Try second one maybe. Try it, maybe. Yeah. Okay. Okay, right. I thought I put in my last name, guess not, but. That's all right. Okay. If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or? That'd be great. Yeah? Okay. Functional requirement by me Ebenezer. Okay. Okay, so we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some open ended questions, just, what are your opinions on the remote control, got a lot of responses, and we asked some very specific questions, and we got a lot of good feedback. Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. Okay. Okay. So we got some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. I often lose my remote control, the back of the couch, some place, and even if it's not lost permanently, it takes me a few minutes to find it. Most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. I remember trying to load a DVD player recently, and there were so many buttons, it took me don't maybe ten minutes to go through each button, 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons, there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And if they do, not very often. Takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, they're just not great to use. We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls, people do not like remote controls. Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. Now don't get excited yet, I've got more to say on that. Most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, they want it to be different, everybody has a white remote control with black buttons, and a red button and a green button, not everybody wants that. Finally, my opinion. Yep. The voice recognition thing is cool. And voice recognition, the open source software exist already. It's a bit sketchy at some times, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, you have, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, how many, you can't have that many words. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. I'm pretty sure people would buy it. But after a while people may wanna return it, because if you have to say most people use a remote control for switching to channels, and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time. Using the remote control, ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels, and that's for flickering through channels. So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. However, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. See, there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or don't you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, because there are no restrictions on physical size, or shape, it could be as fancy as you want it to be, it could be like a lollipop or something like that, something weird like that. As long as the voice recognition stuff works, that's that's fine. Okay, yep. So we have the design, that we have the fancy bit, right, the voice recognition's fancy, it's cool, it's different, it's radical, and then we have an extra bit don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, is a big question. Will people be willing to wait for the period that it'll take to train the remote, 'cause I think the remote will get better over time with the same user user, but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to have a bad remote control. And what if you have visitors come round, they stay the night, they wanna use the TV, they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you. How do you account for regional accents and stuff like that. I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, so, do our audience have the money, but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button, it's not a practical. Mm-hmm. So. If you could speed it up a bit. These are things I think we should consider. I think it's cool, I'm sorry? If you could speed it up a bit please. Sure. I'm about to end. Sorry. Cool. I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations. Okay. So. Excellent. Right. Um. Hear from the User Interface Designer now might be an idea. Okay. You've got your presentation now, is it? How did where did where did you get all your information? It's in the folder. Okay. There was a website, right here. Oh. Ah, okay. Technical functions? Mm. No. Yeah. I started making stuff up, then I got an email saying Mm. Okay. Okay, this is a brief run through of the technical functions of the remote. The the presentation is already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would be aimed at controlling multiple devices but there's still stuff of relevance, so press on. Okay. I've looked at a couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. And wasn't really satisfied by what I saw have to say this is more sort of springboard for how these could be improved on. Basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. To save you getting off your backside. And there's two main trends in the sort of design practice. On the one hand and this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models with so many buttons on it about the size of the television set. Giving you every possible function that the device has, the remote control controls. And most of these functions are not going to be used, it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. With and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions. And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, and for the most part for TV remote that would be channel control and volume. And if you if you are wanting to incorporate control of a DV DVD or VCR presumably into that then there's a play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward, record, so forth. Um. My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. But I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what a given user's going to want to do from want it to do most. So, something that is more programmable, that perhaps has the full range of functions available to it you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. So that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls, I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, and have a you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're sort of changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what each direction of the joystick's going to do or what each function button's going to do. This is actually again slightly taking inspiration off of games controllers, the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on those functions are then sort of further specified. And so it's taking taking the lead from that. Um. Okay. Yeah. Right. That's it. If we could hear from our Industrial engineer, or Designer. Yeah. I was still working on stuff, I hadn't got it finished. Alright. Click to save in where do I have to save it? If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder, or project documents. If you save it in there we can open it up from here. What I've done with it, I'm sorry. Shit. I'm just closing it now. Are you finding it okay or? Where I've saved it. If you go to whichever one you were working and you just click file save as. That's it there. Right. Okay. Right I'm responsible for working design, this is basically the inside going on of the remote control. So we have the energy source, we have the user interface, this this is what I've seen. The sender will push the button, the chip will respond, and then the digital signal is sent to the TV. So if you go to next slide, you'll see what do we need on the user interface. Do we need many buttons, or do we need many light bulbs that could be easier to realise which appliances are on or not. Or would that take too much power, would we need more components in there to supply the power? The joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that, there'd be more components to deal with that. Mm-hmm. So dunno exactly what That's the the layout of the electronic design, but obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface. Okay. So, that'll be decided, I guess. And the next slide. If you go to the next slide then. Oh. Yeah. It was a mess, I was just adding it together at the end there. Ah, don't worry about it at all mate. So you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, and the user interface obviously contains everything. You have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, will contact the TV and will have whatever device or DVD player, the bulb will turn on to say it's on. So do we need on the control different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs, would it be easier? I dunno what we should decide on that. Okay. Well. Sorry, I'm interrupting you. Is it? No, it's finished. Okay. Right. Right we can probably skip that for now. So, we've had some stuff put forward, along with the new user requirements, we've had a lot of kind of. I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. Cost. Mm. For example you see that there's fairly robust services on computers via voice, IBM do drag and dictate, but these require a lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements. Mm-hmm. Voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. Kay. That's just my view right now, however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an LCD which has been kind of put forward so far, it's almost like having a small T not TV to say, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an LCD would take, but it might be quite low? Mm. Mm. LCD on the remote just telling you what's on, or interactive LCD or Do you think that people will get mixed up, like, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then, trying to get everything working, would it be a bit confusing? Mm-hmm. Literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a mobile phone, something where you can read an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example, they usually incorporate they have the keypad, and then all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around. Mm. That could be one possibility. And then we could have say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels I would agree with you. Mm. I was thinking that the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but muscle memory's a wonderful thing. Yeah. Mm. And I think that size of display was about what I had in mind. Though I would say that most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white. Simply to keep keep the unit cost down. Colour could be a sort of subsequent development but cost a bit of extra money once everyone's got the first, colour's out, we'll have to replace it won't we. Mm-hmm. It does nothing extra. That would be my feeling as well, I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface. Now I don't go for it. Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu and a joystick if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one, but I think we don't have a specific audience, what is our target audience, what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner. You know, what I'm saying, for whom is this intended? Everybody? I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile. And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people. Most people. If we were to follow that avenue, we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose. Mm. Mm-hmm. But that does cover a very large section of the people out there. Sure. I think that's fair. I imagine as well that the actual LCD and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. Mm. Which maybe doesn't get used as often, maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it. Mm-hmm. And you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, up and down, it depends, maybe we have the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined. Mm-hmm. So we go for the nice standard up and down and volume control. So that literally anybody can come along, pick up the remote and still know what do do. And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the actual owner of the TV and who would normally use the unit. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I dunno. The thing I like about the joystick is that you you then basically you can then basically put it for T T for TV remote alone, like I say the the main things people do with a TV remote control is the volume and the channel. You can pack all that onto onto a single control. Mm-hmm. Um. But the but then obviously if you if you wanted to access further functions you then get to sort of menu navigation. With things like tuning and channels adjusting brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most TVs these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integrating the remote with the device it's controlling. Mm-hmm. Concern about our market. If we are most of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. You've got twenty different devices in your living room, you want one that'll do the job of all of them. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If all you're replacing is however many remotes you have in your living room, you still need separate remotes for everything else. I just think that possibly mm. This is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid, this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on. Mm. So this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed, for now. Mm. So I can understand your point, and I would agree with you, but this is our design spec for now. Fraid to say. I would say so, yes, because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes, and that is a separate unit. Would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? Yeah. I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now. Mm-hmm. And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that. Hmm. Okay, specifically television. Okay. Okay. Maybe we'll hear differently, but for now It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions, yes. So the joystick is just for differentness. Mm. Okay. Just a thought. There is that possibility, yes. Maybe then our market should be TV manufacturers, rather than the public. Try and sell it to them to supply with Mm, I've seen them. However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert, that might be sales, who are not in this meeting. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's just, the way I figure it, twelve point five Euros per unit, we have to sell at least three million or something like that, not to account for all the money we waste on remotes that no one buys, if we made a for every remote we made someone bought it, then we have to sell a lot of remote controls. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We just Is this gonna be enough to to sell? Something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote, which as you said in fact we've probably all done. Yeah. I don't know if it's a gimmick or not, but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle, it will beep and you tell you where it is. I had one of those, and my brother, and my dad, could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally. Um. The other option of course is that I was going to say clapping, digital telephones, for example, of course you have to have that base unit, somewhere where there's a button, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the TV. The clapping one. To a television. Mm. Something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit. Yeah. And something could separate us a bit. I think that's a good idea. That's a good idea. And that way, because we're attaching what would be a small button to the TV, again say what, it would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario would say, or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just I don't power that might be something that we could look into. We're just saying volume. Yep. It's putting a lot on your shoulders there, so that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well. I think so. So. To go on from here. We have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. Before we leave this meeting, it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get, this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique. Sorry, we're gonna go for a remote control obviously, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the LCD. Mm. Mm. I think that's. Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume, and Okay. For volume. Yep. But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most. Once per hour, channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour, that's by far the biggest one, and then teletext, is still here, that's fourteen, and volume selection. Think so. Mm-hmm. Volume selection okay, yep, the teletext we're gambling with, and we're gonna say it's dead, the way of the dodo So sorry, we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, LCD, and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? No, okay okay. Mm-hmm. So we're having very very few buttons involved, but navigation around a menu for most things. Actually Actually I would say maybe two function buttons, we're now using the menus button and an and an okay button. Certainly something I've found with the joystick on the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. Okay. Okay. Or vice versa. And that's really irritating. Okay. The the other design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are very much used to using a remote control one handedly, so we need to make sure that even with the joystick, something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb. So actually that sounds like a rough idea. Do we incorporate the idea of trying to locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Do you mind looking? I think because it's so small if we only have two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that. The ability to locate it again. So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the TV, just so that it says find me, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, can maybe hide it in the base. Light bulb as well, no? Oh. Sorry? So so a small speaker you mean. Speaker. Some speaker, sorry. And a light bulb? No. To flash. No. We might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate the true fact, considering the cost of an LED, we could just incorporate it anyway. Nah, you'd see it anyway, if you hear it. Those little key-rings have both, so. Yeah. Yeah. The LEDs can be surprisingly bright now. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um. Blue ones particularly. Plus that's a nice wee design touch. Yeah. So by the sounds of it, with what we're suggesting so far, the user interface is still quite open, you could go for quite an interesting design. Because we're only going to have a very few and you've got a small LCD, joystick, I think it leaves you open to a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If you could look into what we've suggested so far, the feasibility of small transmitter, and such, maybe if an LCD screen requires too much power, or such. Ebenezer, Marketing Expert If, you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken, where of a joystick to control the very basic functions, and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile. I can give you the frequency, what options people use most often, I guess that's gonna be important in defining the software side of the interface, right. You want the stuff. Okay. Okay. I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame, but could be something we could maybe look into. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. Okay. Any last comments that anybody would like to put forward? Anything that they think has been missed out. Bit of a wide open question there of course. Mm. Feel free to email me if you think that we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible. Sure. Kay. Right. Yeah. So I should just look at the speaker, the speaker and an LED. And a transmitter. Speaker and LED for transmitter getting the external power source, yep, that's quite true. Transmitter. Actually one one wee thought about that. If we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television. And something that we can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say. Yeah. The electronics could be either placed externally or internally, makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control, so that's good. Mm-hmm. Uses maybe gives us a new potential market. Mm-hmm. Kay. I think if we get a major television manufacturer to say we'll have that, save us the bother, then that's vast amounts of sales. Fashion. Quite quickly. One thing that we've almost not talked about at all, my apologies for that, user interface, we also need to maybe get the slogan in here, I'm pointing at my laptop, what in God Real reaction, and such. So sorry. The slogan's we put the fashion in electronics, isn't it? My apologies. No it could well be, I've probably missed that. I think that's almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top. S also look cool. So I'm not too concerned that we haven't gone into depth about that. Mm. But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes? In fact we might like to put a slogan on, and possibly the two Rs to signify the company. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Rather than real reaction. Mm. Yeah. I thought the the double arc could perhaps be the enter button. Sounds good. And I'd say that that's us for now. Okay.",
