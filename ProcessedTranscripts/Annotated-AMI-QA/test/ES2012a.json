    "displayText": "Right welcome to the first meeting of Real Reaction's development meetings for our new television remote control. This follows our very successful entry into the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to build on, taking advantage of the the latest developments in technology and the latest feelings in consumer design and demand we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody, one that everybody wants, at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company. And to that end we need all to work together to do that. And in no particular order because everybody is just as vital to this project I'll just go round the table, Andrew, marketing, Kendra with designing the the User Interface and Kate with the industrial design. Mm. Um. What's the project is here to do, is to get this project up and moving, everybody is free to say whatever they want, everybody has a contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to say what you want to say. In terms of the immediate meeting everybody knows everybody else, everybody's worked for the company for a while, if anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do, if if anybody wants to briefly give their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody's experience is please do so. In fact I'd I'd welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves, in fact we will do that by going round the table quickly and saying what contribution you're looking to make. So we'll start with Andrew. My name's Andrew I'm the Market Research person for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control I'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design, what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view. Right Kendra. I'm Kendra and I'm the User Interface Designer and I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'll be working on the design. Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so. Right. Yep, I'm just open to being creative. Yep, good. Katie, I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be guess presenting about the inter workings of our little remote control and. Okay, very very quickly, I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the whole idea is that it's a think tank. Everybody says what they want to say, and we don't want to be constrained by kind of convention or slides on screens or anything else but briefly this is what we want to do. The remote control needs to be original, there has to be something about it that other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that's different, I want one, and that goes along with being trendy, the I want it scenario. User-friendly as we all know, remote controls can be very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think yes it's obvious how that works, and they also want to look at the price and think that's something that I may not need another remote control but it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one. And last but not least, or indeed first of all, it it must make the company money, and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants. The further work to be done is the functional design, what it must actually do, the conceptual design, how we actually present that to the consumer and the detailed design is how we get that into production. Now the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is the white board and let us very quickly do what it says in the in the prompt slide here, In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the the wires, that we don't do that, So I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll do a virtual drawing on on the whiteboard of your your own favourite animal, but let's go round the table, your favourite animal. Badger. Mm and why? It's got nice contrast with black and white and I feel they're underdog kind of status and. Uh-huh. Right my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the white streaks in it. Kendra. Probably a duck I I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever. Uh-huh. Right, okay. Uh-huh, fair enough. I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest, homo sapien because of their overall ability to Sorry? Indeed absolutely yes, that's Okay and we need to keep in mind here that we want to sell this for twenty five Euro we want to make an overall profit for the company of fifty million Euros so we're looking at selling a lot of these across the entire planet and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent. It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make. So a very trendy original product, we're looking at making it at a very good price. Okay, would anybody to start by giving their sort of quick views of current remote controls. I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it's handiest when you have one that works both the DVD player or whatever and the TV as well. But that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use. No. Any thoughts about buttons or any other way of approaching the the problem? Or anybody else, strong feelings about remote controls? Are there bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again? I think it's important that when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the TV to actually pick up the signal. Yeah. Yeah. Think a lot of the time, remotes that come with TV players and TVs and DV players, like they aren't like an area that's put a lot of effort into, they're very boring, very plain. Mm. It's a very making a stylish remote control would be very Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition. Mm. What so what's in what particular style features are you thinking about? Um. Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control. So if you want, something that looks like something that makes you think what's this? This pen doesn't really look like a pen, but it makes you think. Uh-huh. So, sorry that's a bit vague. No do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control, people won't see it as a remote control and Uh-huh. I suppose that's up to the marketing to make people aware of the product. Any other thoughts about the physical appearance of remote controls? I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big, rectangular things and they're kind of awkward to hold onto, so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better. Mm. Mm. The thing that immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and some quite fancy ones than some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or Yes, the only thing is if you're watching television in a darkened room you need to be able to find the button buttons easily. From the mouse idea you could, remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press, whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see, a mouse button. Mm. I suppose. Easily. But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better. Mm. Mm. That's must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons. Do we need it to I can't think of any remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all. Do we want. Mm that would be good. A mobile phone? Mm. Yeah. Mm, that would be good. Mm. Okay. Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to take over the planet with? Mm-hmm, especially if we try to sell, what two million of them. Sorry, four million of 'em, but I think if we market it as not as not this you could either market it as the point of view we could have parallel marketing schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool, is fashionable and like it's it's like it's one that rather than I I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device, but that might considering what the device is for and the nature of some people might not respond to having a device that they just looks nice, therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also a device that is practically sound. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So I dunno we'll have to decide which angle we're gonna go to or both. Okay, I think any facets that we identify we need to aim for all of. If you. Mm. Okay first thoughts on the industrial design side. I think it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause you depend on them so much, but it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work, you don't think of them as a computer can break down and you're kinda fair enough gonna get messed up eventually. They just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it needs to be very effective, very always dependable. Indeed. I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it can't be too big like you were saying big and huge and awkward, but also if you make it too small kinda like how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and. Yeah. But so yes dependable, and have a good medium range size. Okay, and colours, materials? Kendra, anyone? I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey, so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different what are they called? The face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that, where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different things. Yeah. Mm, mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Have it kind of look how they want to, different colours, things like that, probably just plastic because that's always the lightest. Right. Yeah. Okay Again I don't think that's ever been done before, it's the sort of thing that would get people thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and might need so. Mm-hmm. Andrew, any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on the remote control? We could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with you buy it with several you get the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing, but maybe thinking of that, it's considering the nature of the device, maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where you generally get one and then forget about it. Mm. Yeah. Unless you were trying to Mm. Yeah. You could come up with novelty ones, like they've done with the mobile phones, you can get different scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money. I think Mm-mm. Yeah. That's a that's a good idea. Yeah. Mm. Right, okay I think we've got a good idea now. True. We Needs to be wrapped up fairly quickly. So we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the design in more detail. Then we will reconvene in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas more formalised. Thank you very much indeed. Okay. Thank you.",
