    "displayText": "Is that alright now? Okay. Sorry? Okay, everybody all set to start the meeting? Okay, we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design. Could you plug me in? Okay. Thanks. All ready to go? Okay. Okay. So hopefully you've all been working away, and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder. So I guess just to recap on what we did last time. Kind of got to know each other a little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss a bit about the project, cost-wise how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements, which is the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is. Nobody uses teletext very much anymore, so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control. Kay. They've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television, not the VCR, DVD or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into production, the time to market. Okay. So we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the TV. And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design. I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is. It might be yellow, because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere. And the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan? That's the thing, I'm not sure because on the company website, what does it say something Is that something they want actually written on it, 'cause it's quite long. Bout putting the fashion in electronics. Mm. Or just the idea, but I'm not sure. So that's something we can discuss as well. So those are the three things, just not to worry about teletext, only control the TV, and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company. So is everybody okay with any of that, or do you want me to recap at all? Nope, we're all set. Right time for presentations then. Who would like to go first? I'll go first. Sure. Okay, cool. Alright can I steal this from the back of your laptop? Of course. So this is the technical functions design. Go on ahead. Right to do the design I've had a look online, I've had a look at the homepage, which has given us some inspiration from previous products. Mm-hmm. I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting. Unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room, so having a look at the existing products, I found out that it tends to come in sort of two extremes, there's either a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colours, very confusing, don't. Right. Okay. In that case the labelling tends to be very bad. There's an example I'll show you at the end, show you now. Here the button there and there. Alright. This one's prog. Sorry. That one's perg and that one's prog, and it doesn't really tell you what it does. Not sure if you had a look at the other control in that example. It's a very simple one. It's got only the basic functions mm but it's the same size as the hard to use one. Oop. It looked a bit clunky. They're very big and not very much use for buttons. And it's just very hard to access the advanced functions. There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button. My own preferences, I prefer the clunky one. It's very easy to use. But unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I quite like having on the controls. So I believe the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, or something from the bottom of it. So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences. Not sure of how long we've got, the clunky one is the one on the right. Um. We can chat away for five minutes or so at most. Mm-hmm. Just a couple of minutes anyway. A lot of what I've read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what Craig's just gone over. So in part I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also add some to this which is just about sort of market research. Mm-hmm. But anyway, we might come to that later. We'll stick to kind of your area for now. Which which is the clunky one, the one on left or on the right?.. Okay. Yeah. Clunky in what sense, like heavier? Larger? I think it's supposed to be the same size, but it's got much fewer buttons. It's, very spread out and kind of I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size. I see, so it's more just basic. Looks kind of. Right, okay. Yeah. Got very few buttons on it and do we have any functions that we'd want on it? Yeah. Sure. I think it's a valid point. The one on the left looks quite complicated, and that PROT thing is incredibly confusing. So I see why you might prefer the simpler design, but you don't want to lose out on, what it does, so maybe you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open, I think that's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think it's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So far I've got on and off, switch the channel up and down, and put the volume up and down. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. They're just the very basics you could use for a TV. Uh-huh, and then actual numbers for channels as well. Okay. You say that's a required one or a requested one? Which was that? Would you like the channels like the numbers on thing. Up the numbers, or the up down? God, I would say there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days if you can't actually individually select channels, would anybody disagree with that? Yeah. Yeah. What else, So don't need to worry about VCR, any kind of display controls at all do you think we need to worry about, brightness and contrast? We don't? No? Yeah. I think essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? Mm. Is that right? Is that what we're we're doing? Yeah. We're kind of like sorting them Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have? To start with sort of a bit both, we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible. I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice? Mm-hmm. Okay, right. Do you wanna maybe just, at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a function of this. Yeah. Yep. So so far, just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Right okay. There's on and off, volume and channel, and skip to certain channels with the numbers. Mm-hmm. One way I would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. And also think maybe a little bit about sorta what would just wanna be easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Mm-hmm. Maybe they're they're they're in a little area but covered up things like channel and volume are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, just very sort of self-explanatory. So maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls, like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. And others that are also available and then others that are concealed. Something like that. Okay. Just to wrap up quickly on this little section Have I just lost no. Do you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirements, and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and set up and things like that, maybe like a mute button, that sort of thing. Yeah. Any of you anything to add to that at all? No. No. I'll add it later, guess the presentation. Okay, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, if we can move on to next presentation then please. Sure. Do you wanna Probably not, actually. Do you want to switch places? Can this can this reach? Can this plug come across? No. No. No. So why don't I just pick up and move then. Yeah. Here, Why don't I just Mm er, can you go behind me? Just just switch them. Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now. Bit complicated. It'd be nice if everything was wireless, wouldn't it? Okay. Right. Um. So I can say already, dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the issues and the the things. Overlap between what you said? For all that'll happen. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but what I've already started doing is I created a slide in my presentation here so that we kind of think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine, because certainly I have a hard time separating things completely. Obviously what you've just told me impacts a lot on market research mm that I've been So how do I get this up? Mm hard to know where your role ends. Okay. Function F eight. Press function and F eight. Okay. Okay. Alright. So F eight? Function, the blue button. Next to the control on the left. And F eight. Yeah. Mm. You have to push it together. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay, I think that that's doing it now. Nope. Try that again. Again? Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose. Wait. Okay. You wanna here we go. Okay great. Yep, there we go. There you go. Okay. Just Before I bring this up what I'll just say is what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing. And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, 'kay what what are our options, what should we decide and do you know what I mean, so. Increase that 'cause we can't see the That's much better. Okay. Okay. Right. Can you Right, okay. There you go. Okay. Alright. That would be Okay. So does that make sense? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities. Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through. So I'm thinking here primarily about customer needs, that we start with the customer, and what they want and what are issues with existing products. To think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics. And then, as I say we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and Dunno. Bouncing on top. Okay. Yeah. Um. So a lot of this is new to me, so we'll just read through together. Users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. So they find them ugly. Most people find them ugly. The vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well, later, the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control, such as voice recognition. Mm-hmm. Okay we'll look at that in a second. Most people use only a very slim portion of all the controls. So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this technology, they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them. Mm-hmm. So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take for me this is sorta three different different inspirations, one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands. Frustrations. They get lost a lot, as it came up in our last meeting. Takes time to learn how to use them. This is why I mention when Craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls, so it doesn't just look like a big panel, kinda like when you look at, a new computer keyboard, or something that is quite explanatory. If you want audio, if you want visual, then you have those. And I will admit I don't know what RSI stands for. Repetitive strain injury. Is installing a new remote control something that I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market, in terms of people. No, that did not come up at all. So here is sort of a review here of the main things. I also found that adults at least would pay more for voice recognition. Now apparently we do have access to all the cutting edge technology in remote control. So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it. Um. And and again here as we sort of move sort of start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this, I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy. Mm-hmm. People additionally aren't liking the appearance of their products, so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can put that into a unit which people like. They like the aesthetics and the ergonomics. Okay. So want something that looks good and is easy to use, big priorities. Yeah. So just looking at what Craig's ideas are sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this. Okay. So if we do say we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology. It's like I find a lot of TVs these days, something really about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can, but they have little panels where you click and there's just tons of features you go through. Mm. So you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together. Yeah. That's I think it's a good idea. Yeah. That's sort of the But I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay, how do we collectively move on with it. Mm-hmm. I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea, although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles, and then use that. Okay. Mm-hmm. But not let that confine us technologically. Okay. Alright? Right. Any comments on all of that? One of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our target audience, our target market. That's. So if we want something that looks good and is easy to use, but is fairly powerful product, whatever, who do we really want to aim that at? Okay. Who would have the money to spend. Where's the money, maybe. Yeah. If twenty five Euro is our selling price then you can imagine, I'm not really sure how much that will retail at. And who watches TV. Mm-hmm. Mm. But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly, I suppose, they're gonna actually go out and buy one. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Who do you think we're aiming this at? Cause twenty five Euros for a remote, how much is that locally in pounds? It's about sixteen, seventeen pounds, I think. Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote? Okay. Mm-hmm. Right. So maybe not the high end range, but maybe middle, up-ish. Okay. Kind of. You know how much? I dunno I guess you pay, what, ten ten quid for a remote? Okay. A simple replacement, right. Yeah. If you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get, how much would you pay? Yeah. This this kinda touches on your comments there, David. These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of what people would pay more for a certain feature. Yeah. Just gives us a rough idea of where the the will to spend money on TV equipment is. Okay Okay. Mostly focused around the twenty five age group. So do you think we're aiming at a fairly young market then? Yep. Sort of young professional, kind of. Okay. Mm-hmm it's the Yep. Did you not say it was the adults that were going for the voice recognition? Do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider? What what do you think, Craig? Sort of the the older group. It does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying, in terms of Okay. Yeah. I think we are gonna have to narrow it down, to say let's target these people and give them what they want 'cause there needs to be some kind of selling point to it. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. So anything there to add Just kind of young professionals, if we are going to include speech recognition, it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be a really high response to that. Mm-hmm. So we could say that was our target. I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, so fifteen to thirty five, look fairly young. Yeah. Yeah. They have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing. Mm-hmm. I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer, who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I think people who are maybe about wouldn't say thirty five, but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But. Yeah. Sure. So. Mm-hmm. So these are people who are gadgety, right? People who are growing up used to, in schools and in universities, when you go on to their working lives, people who would. Yeah. So they'll not not shy away from something quite high-tech. Yeah. Yeah. That that's that's a good point. Mm. Okay, so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition if we can. If we can. I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now, because based on what you've everybody's saying, right, you want something simple. Yeah. Okay. Why is that? You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use. Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use. Right. Okay. Could it be an on off thing? But what I'm saying is that we're trying to lock ourselves into a particular kind of technology, rather than focusing on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say, and then, say speech recognition is not good for this. If you want it on. Where you can activate it and deactivate it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Sure. So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition, anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function, but at end of the day we don't look at the technology, but we look at the function first. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yep. Okay, do you wanna give us your presentation and then don't might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss, but this is how we're exactly. Okay, sure. Yep. It's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind. Not. It's something that's just occurred to me as well is speech if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as well. Um. And not losing. And also it helps in terms of people not losing this, they're saying I lose it in the couch. Yeah. Yeah. What we're sort of getting into here is mating different design features together that they Right. Mm-hmm. I reckon one problem with speech recognition is I've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing, so you end up yelling at the control for hours. Really? Channel up. Really, you've seen one before. Do you think maybe we need further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though? I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in. Sorry, do you mind passing me my notepad. Mm. Course not. Thanks. Cool. There you go. Okay. Um. Right. This is just the working design. Mm-hmm. This is just how I would go about it. I guess I try to define what we're doing now, try to define what we're trying to get done. I think in a practical way, we kind of know what it is. Right. We're familiar with it, but we can't we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil, Besides the basics, back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are. Has to change volume, but in specifics, right, which one of the basics are you trying to target. Mm-hmm. Are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics? And the idea is just to get everybody to I usually have have a design that's there as a basic, so, things that to start everything going. But I guess everybody does have some idea, so I don't think there's a need for that. Okay this finding things is a little bit confusing, so I'll go into the diagram first. It just explains how the process goes through, from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better. Mm-hmm. Okay, you need some power source. Kay, a battery or something, to keep it going. Mm-hmm. And that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last. Uh-huh. It ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want. Mm-hmm. For example, voice recognition, right. That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone, you might need to power other things, so that's one perhaps constraint there. Okay, the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes, whatever. Hmm. And that picks up an input from a user, a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device, and the device has to based on you push button A, so I will do something with button A. So maybe is the power button, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here. And I think that's about it in terms of my design. It's fairly general, and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking, voice recognition, right, if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power. Mm-hmm. So it's not really a constraint in that sense, but these are functionally, the base, what the technology has to do. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. So I think maybe you wanna go back to what the functions are? I think that's more relevant to a discussion? Kay. Uh. Do you wanna finish up your whole presentation then? Sure. Sure. I'm done. Are you are you all done? More or less. Yeah. It's just putting the rest of it into words, but it's essentially the same thing. Yep. Mm. You have a transmitter, an input device, logic chip, stuff like that. Okay. Okay. Right. I guess this would be Yep. Right. And on the means Since we're on the topic of the technology, what are our options? Alright, what in Is this the only way that we go about it, or are there other Right. These aren't technology options in that sense. This is just a basic principles and basic components that are needed. The basic principle of 'Kay. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. For example, if you needed to add a voice recognition, right, then your user interface would be broken down into more components, right, which you have a microphone, the VR and stuff like that. Okay. Mm-hmm. Oh. Okay. So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing. Yep. Okay. Yep. So each component represents one function, but I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, and the receiver, okay, and the power are things that you won't have to care about. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it. Mm-hmm. Okay. There might be one other consideration which would be that the transmission between the remote control and the TV for example. Okay. Okay, are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing? Okay. Okay. Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to. Okay. Right. Right. A worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would effect how long it took us to get this to market, so I suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it because it's tried and tested intra-red, so we could stay with Mm-hmm Oh. Yep. There might be one other problem with the transmission, in particular right now, since we're talking about voice recognition. If somebody's gonna talk to the device, you ideally want them to hold it to them. You may not require that, but it's it's something very natural, guess, to hold it, to signal to the user, and push a button maybe to start talking about it. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Then you need to send the signal out, so because if you're using infra-red, the line of sight say the TV's at that chair, and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here, it blocks it. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. So in that sense, there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process. Right. Okay. Not so much further down. Okay. And just a clarification before we finish this. Is our controller is it have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment, so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment? There's not much specific specific information, but I think that one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices. Yeah. Okay. Because infra-red is something which everybody has. In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the TV, so that's what we should do for now I think. Just to TV, okay. Okay. Something I was wondering about was the power. Is it worth considering having a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries? Is that something we really want to go into, do you think, or should we just consider running on regular batteries? There's Okay, from a from a component point of view there's added complexity, and you add cost to it, and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You need a docking cradle, for example, for you to put it in to charge. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Or you need to get the user to plug it in. And most users are very already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller. Okay, so. But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries, like he's gonna run through twenty batteries a month, then I don't think rechargeable is something we really need to care about. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so just stick to regular Okay. Um. Right. So basically I'm just gonna just recap what I said at the start, was that the whole point of this meeting was to absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at, and what exactly the product's gonna do. Okay. Okay. So just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket? That's good. And also the the actual functions of what it's gonna do. Do you wanna recap on that, Craig? Um. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. On off, up and down channels, up and down volume and skip to a channel. Okay, right. Ta. And is it going to include any of the more advanced features, or are we gonna eliminate those? I think we include mute, but apart from that I think we'll go for the simpleness. Okay. Okay. Okay, Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? Is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just sort of under sort of under a door or some 'Cause what I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then they, get ours and it's doesn't have that. It's as optional functions. Yeah. I dunno if that'd be a problem. Okay. Mm-hmm. Maybe I could suggest we break them down into three simple categories. Yeah. Okay. One would be audio controls, one would be video controls, and the other one would be a device. Mm-hmm. Okay. This may not map very well to advanced functionality especially, but from a manufacturer's point of view, from a person designing the device, but I think from a point of view of a person using the device, a TV is something they see and something they hear, it's something they do other things to turn it on and turn it off. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So what we could have is three buckets, right, where we could throw things into, if we want this feature, let's throw it into there, and then from there decide whether it's basic, or it's non-basic. Right. Yeah. Kay, okay. It might help with the visualisation. Like that. Okay. And it would actually help with the component build as well. Mm-hmm. Okay, right. Mm okay, great. Okay I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now. Next thing we're doing is having lunch. Whoohoo. And then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage. So I'll be putting the minutes of this meeting into the project documents folder. Mm-hmm. So I guess just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway, for our Industrial Designer, you're gonna be thinking about the components concept. Mm-hmm. User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface, and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching. And you'll all get specific instructions as well. So I dunno, just to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking. Do you wanna start with David. Anything else to say at all? Mm no, not really. No, okay. I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up, shall we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we resume that we'll use this idea David's proposed, where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of, okay, we're talking about this. Andrew? I think that's definitely a good idea. Uh-huh. Shall we do that, then? Mm. Yeah. Okay, great. Just about the three buckets, what would go in the device functions one? Things on off. Because they don't have anything to do with what you see. Yeah. In terms of picture and the entertainment value, And channel. Okay. And and channel. Right. Because the on off also goes, on off power, not on off sound. Not on off video. Yeah. Although you don't turn off the video on your TV, but you might wanna turn off the sound, say you wanna pick up the phone, there's a mute button, right, so you have you have a choice of putting it on to others or a device. Okay. Okay. Device is basically anything which we can't categorise, right. Okay, so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be your bass settings and actual volume Okay. We put it out. Mm-hmm. Anything to do with what you hear, right. Mm-hmm. You you put that into audio. Okay, and then visual Okay, so brightness, contrast, things like that, and then just actual device things, like what channel you're watching, turning on an off, stuff like that. Mm-hmm. And then video is anything that you can see. Mm-hmm. Um. Yep. Colour. Yep. Sure. Sure. Yep. Okay. Okay, Mm-hmm. And then I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category there might be some which are just the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more. Random which we have no other place to put, but we need it somewhere there. Yeah. Sure, okay. Okay. Okay. Even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind. I think that's one thing that and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are fixed. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I guess just things to think about are the fact it's gotta look good, because of who we're targeting this at. Something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe. Mm-hmm.
