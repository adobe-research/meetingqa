    "displayText": "It's just that I need some white paper. Are you gonna take the minutes? Yes. Good. Yep. So hello everybody. Hello. So everybody had the agenda for today, you received it or Yep. Hello. Hello? Do you have an extra copy? Thanks. So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month, so for this month of April, and also discuss the content for an advertising posters and I will present you three different design, we'll discuss it. Mm-hmm. So first we have to decide for a movie. Okay. So I think we all prepared documents. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, I did. So I propose that we start with presentation Agnes sent. Sure. Okay, so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now and Amadeus, which were all historical, serious, dramatic and somewhat actiony movies. So for this month I propose doing something different, preferably something set in the present, something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious. So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery. And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries, some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying, never saw that coming, I didn't know that that was gonna happen. And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies, and before anyone says that, if you know how the movie ends, you're not gonna wanna see it again, that's not necessarily the case, because a lot of people like to re-watch movies to see where the clues were, what they missed, things they didn't pay attention to the first time around. So if you can go to the next slide. What I'd propose is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense. Mm. The Usual Suspects is slightly less mainstream. Has a fairly large cast, notably Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and it was directed by Bryan Singer, it's one of his earlier movies I think. It was written by Christopher McQuarrie. And according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest, funniest and scariest crime thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction. The Sixth Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line, I see dead people. Ah. It was written and directed by M Night Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette, and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people, what it means. Hmm. And actually the psychologist is dead. Now that you've given away the twist, yes. No, but we're the clubbers, but Agnes, I was just wondering, I have here Denis's table, and when they say that it's the freshest whatever since Pulp Fiction, that's probably not a very long time, because Pulp Fiction is ninety four and Usual Suspects is ninety five. Yep. Mm. Okay. Send your complaints to Rolling Stone. Yeah. So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes. The length for The Usual Suspects is a hundred and five minutes. As you can as Andrei already said, it's nineteen ninety five. It has an R rating, which means that at least in the in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen, 'cause it's fairly violent, but not so violent as other movies. Plot outline five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them. After release they get together for a spot of revenge, but someone else is controlling events. And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events. It got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the Internet Movie Database, it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time, forth in Denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties, which I think was also taken from IMDB. Yep. Mm-hmm. It won several Academy Awards, including best supporting actor and best writing, best film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards, it was nominated for best foreign film. So it got a fair bit of recognition despite not being a very mainstream, high budget movie, or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream, high budget movie. Mm-hmm. So what will be your argument for projecting this movie? I don't think a lot of people have seen it, in fact, other than you haven't seen it, you haven't seen it, you've seen it. I haven't see it. I haven't seen it. Yep. And don't think a lot of people have seen it, it's not a very very well known movie. What? It's very well known. Is it? Yeah. It's a One hundred thousand. Really? I think. See? It's one of the most well known thriller. Really? That surprises me, I always got the impression that it was. Oh. It's it's hard to tell. Yeah. So that's your impression. That's my impression. Yeah. That's mine, but. But it's rated four fourth in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand seen it. It's a good movie. How many people voted for it? That's true. Yeah. One hundred and two. Voted for it. For voted for it. Voted for it, and I think only two other no, three other movies have more votes. More votes? It seems to be quite popular. Yeah. So but I think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and it's it's an interesting movie to watch. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So if you go to the next slide. More or less the same thing for The Sixth Sense. It's slightly newer, nineteen ninety nine, more or less the same amount of time. It has a lower rating, 'cause it's less violent, but it depends what audience we are gonna have at the showings. Yeah. Isn't violent at all in fact, or it's more scary or Uh-huh. It has it's scary and I think it has some sort of slight violence, but. But the kid is seeing dead people, it's quite No, but it's quite morbid you can say that? But they're not violently dead. Scary or mm-hmm. It's it's morbid and it's creepy, but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that. Morbid. Creepy or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's nineteenth in the top movies of the nineties, hundred first in the top two hundred fifty, it was nominated for a lot of awards, it didn't win as many. Might have won more sort of minor awards, but at least the Academy Awards, it was nominated for five of them, but didn't win. Nevertheless still a good movie, still a good twist at the end, which Denis already gave away. Mm-hmm. They don't remember. Good. So those would be my two choices. Have you seen it? Yep. Okay. What was you criteria for selecting this movie But then it's only at the end that it becomes a good movie. Let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen, and they have a twist, so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go, okay, get up and leave. It's at least out of those two movies I came out thinking, cool, okay. Mm-hmm. But that's a good thing, right? Only because of the of the end. Okay. I've heard some people in the theatre saying, now we have to see it again. Yes. Yeah. Ah. Which is a good marketing ploy, if you think about it. But then if you asked them five minutes ago okay. If we show it twice. Okay. Is Bruce Willis the child psychologist? Bruce Willis is and the kid is really good, who plays the main character. Ah. Yeah. Great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's the guy who then played in Artificial Intelligence or something like this, mm-hmm. Great. Same guy. Okay, so I think, you prepared a presentation also. Yeah. We can have a look. So my presentation is not that detailed, I just put there seven highly ranked movies, and we can just try to go very quickly through all of them, just to remind you them, and then we can perhaps consider another potential candidates. Sorry, it's control L I have seen it, but I don't remember it. Okay, so the movies that I have selected as very good good ranked movies are on the screen so The Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List, Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Silence of the Lambs and American Beauty. Mm. So perhaps we can go to the to the first movie. The Shawshank Redemption actually I didn't see that movie, so is there someone else who have seen this movie? No. Me neither. I've heard a lot of really good things about it, but Mm-hmm. Okay. So I was told that in French it was called Les Evadees. Which is not good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, the plot outline says that the life of Andy Dufresne okay, of Andy, changes when he's convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife, and the user comment says it's simply amazing, the best film of the nineties. Yeah. So that's what it says, okay, we can't tell much more, because basically none of us have seen it. Should we should we believe this? But the rating is very good then. Mm-hmm. So the second one is a Schindler's list, it's more serious movie, it's from the Steven Spielberg and it's about the Second World War. The plot outline is that the Oskar Schindler uses Jews to start a factory in Poland during the war, and he witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews and starts to save them. User comment says, a film for all to see and learn, and I think it's really something what is very serious theme and. So that's a Schindler's List, perhaps do you have some comments? I I have seen it. It's it's quite long actually, here I didn't put the minutes, but I think it's at least about three hours. I think it's about three hours long, something like that. And it's a heavy movie, I it's emotional, it's I think it did. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If it's to if it received some award? No, I don't know, unfortunately. Or Probably no? I think also but. Either for director if not for best picture. Maybe even best picture. But I would expect it. I would expect it. Mm-hmm. Okay, so if you can go to the It's a true story. But indeed, it's maybe too sad and too, poignant for Mm-hmm. It's a true story also, so. Yeah. It's I would say that the user comment says everything, a film to see and to learn. And to remember maybe, or. And to remember as well. Mm. Okay, so the third one is The Usual Suspects. So I think I wouldn't I don't want to comment it again, so we can just skip that, because this is the one already commented by Agnes. So let's go to the to the other one. Pulp Fiction. I would say that's like a classical movies of nineties, it's directed by Quentin Tarantino, it's a crime and drama, it's a there are several stories that are just mixed up during the movie, and it's a real classical movie, would say almost nowadays. So I've seen it. So who has seen it? Agnes, you've seen it? I've seen it. I've seen it too. It's very good and it's a bit violent, but it's also quite funny I think. Yeah. So all of us. Sure, sure, you can see it several times, because the first time you cannot catch all the details, and then when you see it second times and third times it's big comeback, of John Travolta, yes. It's a Mm-hmm. And it's the comeback of John Travolta, no? So Big comeback. That was his comeback movie. I would say good comeback. Bruce Willis is there also. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who is there? Huh. The boxer. Sorry? Pardon? Bruce Willis is there as a boxer. As the boxer. And what's the name of the girl on the poster. Yes. Uma Thurman, okay. It's Uma Thurman. Uma Thurman. Okay, so Pulp Fiction, definitely should be considered. Yep. So on the list I I brought on the on my document, the two movies, Pulp Fiction and Usual Suspect are just swapped. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Pulp Fiction is actually coming before The Usual Suspect. Wow, that's interesting. How. Maybe 'cause IMDB is updated daily, so if it happens that people had voted for it Mm-hmm. That may be. Because I have I have this review on Wednesday. Mm-hmm. Tuesday, it's quite surprising though, but okay. Okay. It's strange, with so many votes that they can shift. It's Goodfellas, I haven't see that movie. Yeah. Statistically speaking it's strange. The plot outline says that the Henry Hill and his friends work their way up through the mob hierarchy, and the user comment says, it's simply a masterpiece, and if you go to the to the votes, there is quite a lot of people who has vote for the Goodfellas, sixty six thousand. Okay, it's modern day average, so it's perhaps not a bad movie. Mm-hmm. Wow. Mm. I dunno, I haven't see that. Actually I have seen it, now I realise. You have seen it? Have you? Yeah? No, because I thought it was another movie, but it's this movie actually. Mm-hmm. But it is this movie. But it was that movie? Okay. Uh-huh. Ah okay. And how was it called, Mafia? Les in French. I think it that one, but it's very violent. Okay. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Very. It doesn't say it here, but it's probably rated R. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. So it talks about the nineteen twenties or something of twenties? No, it's later than that, isn't it? It speak about a guy who is not Italian, who is going up in the hierarchy of mafia. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, so. So. Not really in favour of this, but Ah. The mob, so the mob is the mafia actually? Mob is mafia, mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Silence of the Lambs, that's a godfather of all thrillers, I would say. Fully in line with the user comments. Basically it's a thriller, horror and crime all together. The plot outline says that the Clarice Starling, the young FBI agent is assigned to help find a missing woman and save her from the psychopathic killer with the help of another killer. Another killer is actually in a jail and it's Anthony Hopkins, and he really plays it a very good, I would say. I'm not sure whether he received some awards for that, but it's Yes, very good performance, very good performance. I don't know, but it was a good performance, creepy. Mm-hmm. And Jodie Foster is very good as well. Yeah. And we can see her actually on the picture on the projector. Mm-hmm. She was pretty young, no? For. I think, when I saw this movie some time ago and she looked quite young I thought. I think so. From when is the movie? When did it come out? Ninety one. Ninety one. Yeah. Ninety one. So nowadays she's already fourteen years older. Yep. As are we all. Yeah. And I saw this movie when I was twelve or thirteen and it was really really bad experience. Me too. So I can't remember all the details of that movie, but I would like to see it again. I don't think I've seen it since then. Mm-hmm. Recently I saw the Hannibal, that the it was a third part actually, it was called Hannibal guess. Ah. No, on the second one. It was second one. Yeah. So that's why It was really disgusting. But not that good, no? It wasn't that good, but I think it was almost more disgusting in a way There were some scenes in it where normally I don't get queasy watching movies, but that was just too much. Yeah. Okay, what's your opinion? Okay. You have seen it? I've seen it. It's a good movie, don't maybe too well known, but since it's fifteen years old maybe people would. It might be a little bit too violent for dunno. Violent and scary as well. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Psychopathic, it's Okay. And last choice. And the last choice that I think it's not a bad movie, it's American Beauty. That's a good movie. It's basically about the people in America, each of them is would say psychotic in his own way, but normally they appear to be normal people, as we can see them every day. Yep, that's a good one. And it's the user comments say it's a deep, wonderful, penetrating film, extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about American life, and I can fully agree with this user comment. I I've seen this movie, but I. And Kevin Spacey? It's no, Kevin Spacey, he received something, no? It's Kevin Spacey. Again? Quite possibly. He's actually quitting his job at the beginning, but he's simulating a fight with his boss in order to to pursue to. Mm-hmm. I see. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. To sue him afterward. Mm-hmm. And then. But then he fell in love the with the with the friend of his daughter, if I remember well. Yeah. Yeah. That's really Maybe. Ah, that's the girl who is represented on the picture? Yep. Theoretically. You recognise her belly? No there is this rose, because she's he's imagining her taking baths with roses all around and he's. Yeah. So you recognise the rose. That's true. Exactly. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. What will be your preferred one in this list? And I think that's the last If would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely go for Schindler's List, and if not then. Yeah. I would like to see this Shawshank Redemption, because it none of us seen this movie unfortunately, but as you can see from your from your table, there is a plenty of votes. The first one. Probably you received. Actually I think it's a movie with highest number of the votes, it is. That's true. And it's Tim Robbins who is the guy Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. Yeah. Great actors. But I see this name of the director on the slide, but I don't really know him. Mm-hmm. Darabont. Frank Darabont? Me neither, me neither. Mm. Never heard of this guy. But really I would like to highlight that it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. So. Okay. Yep, it tells something. Okay, it's just a do we want to have to display the most popular movie or we're. Let's go through the other suggestions. I'm not sure. And actually I don't think it's it's that popular in Europe at least, because see, none of us have seen it, so. Yeah. That's right. Mm-hmm. Maybe. But it's true, we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table. Though it's a very useful table, but okay, do you want me to. Okay, Andrei, can you comment your. So I wrote some notes on Saving Private Ryan, which is my candidate. If you can display them it's perfect. Do you all have a copy of them? I do. I have some paper copies. I thank you. You're welcome. So actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was history, drama, action, and given also that, we decided to present this month a movie from the nineties, I thought that among these movies, who look quite popular, Saving Private Ryan would be a very good candidate. Actually it's a movie I've seen. Have you seen it before? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay, so you've all seen it, so maybe everyone has seen it, I'm not very sure. But I think it's a very novel treatment of war, it's no longer the glorification of whatever, combat and victory, but the plot is quite different, it's about saving one person who has a special value in the movie only because his brothers actually were all killed, so the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family, and means actually removing from the front, you remember the plot. So in fact the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor, the main the main character is played by Tom Hanks and actually you can see his picture on the second page of my notes Captain John Miller. So he is sent with this rather strange mission, which is not a combat mission, but they want just to get this guy back, which is in fact this guy is behind enemy lines or something like this. Mm-hmm. So it happens in Europe, just after the Normandy landing, and it's very very striking the way they filmed all the combat scenes and it's very dramatic, it's not, in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously, but here you see everything and you see how many people die on that day. And you enjoyed that, the fact see I To realise how it was exactly. Up close. Actually it's very strange, you could ask this for any sad movie, did you enjoy it. I didn't really enjoy to see bad things, but I think it was satisfying to see how dramatic things are. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Mm-hmm. It's very moving, I it's true, it's not very it's not very, well, happy. I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now, if it's darker or maybe. It's very different, I don't think you can compare them. It's very different. So I think this would continue a bit our theme. So the movie is ranked quite high, if I refer back to your table it's what actually, fourteen. Quite a lot of votes, so also one of the mainstream movies. Mm-hmm. On the second page of my notes I quoted some facts about the movie that I found interesting, we could use them for either a poster or a presentation. Especially I enjoyed the story about the colour saturation. It's true that the movie is not really black and white, but the colours are grey-ish, dark-ish, it it it makes a very moving effect. To make it like an historical movie or mm. I think it's the reference to history and also the mood and things are actually most of the things are quite grey, the uniforms, weapons, things and things like that. Also sets the mood a little bit. Darker but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it. Mm-hmm. Exactly. But if I read your first point in this trivias, I am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors underwent several days of cruel army training except for the Matt Damon, and the reason was that the that the director wanted that the other actors would resent him. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Why this was wanted actually? Mm-hmm. I think Matt Damon is the guy who must be saved, if I remember well, and in fact the die the people didn't understand why they should save one person. Yeah. He's private Ryan. And they didn't like it, they didn't like the mission? They're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died. Oh. And they are quite resentful, because they feel they should fight, they shouldn't just go there and just get someone and get back. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. And it okay. And in fact some of them get killed for this guy. Most of them get killed, don't they? Yes. Actually most of them, I think so. Most of them. Yeah. So there is actually several people dying because of one single soldier, mm-hmm. So. Yeah. Yeah. I think some people compare it with whatever, Christian message or dunno, but I think it's quite quite universal and it's I think it's a modern, very modern this value of one individual, it looks like a Christian message, the value of one is compared to others I don't know I think I heard this at that point, but maybe I'm just wrong. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What kind of message? Sorry, I'm not getting your Okay. Mm-hmm. So I think it would make a coherent choice. It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier, but if we want to keep this idea of history and conflict and also to show some kind of modern treatment of it, it would make for a good choice. Mm-hmm. But if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page I put some other candidate movies. La Vita e Bella is an Italian one, but it's also about history and it happens at the same period as Schindler's List. And I also quoted Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs, a bit more remote from the themes, but quite well known movies and enjoyable would say. Hmm. Do you have any questions about this, or should we just move to the next candidate maybe? Yep. Or you have Okay. Okay. No no it's but I really appreciate your table, because I found this table really useful. Mm-mm. So actually I don't know if any of you have read the document I prepared on The Big Lebowski. Mm-hmm. It's just below the table, since we all refer to the table Mm-hmm. It's below the table. I wanted. It's a very nice summary. I wanted to say that it's quite open, there are many choices possible. Mm-hmm. But then my proposal is The Big Lebowski from the two brothers Coen, brothers. And it's actually Joel Coen who directed the movie. Mm-hmm. The plot is quite hard to make, but maybe you read it already you understood something from the plot or. Yeah. I tried to. Yeah. No, I think the summary is quite good, and especially mm when you read it you just want to go to see the movie. I am? I think it looks funny for me. I haven't seen the movie, but the summary looks funny. It's it's in my opinion like American Beauty, because it's a funny movie but it critiques a lot the American society. And the the hero, the Dude, the mm Big Lebowksi, actually his name, is a kind of non-hero, but he's representative of a normal LA LA guy. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And he has a friend veteran from Vietnam and another friend who is never speaking. And they all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about everything. Mm-hmm. They seems to have no job, not we never seen them working. So doing nothing, just take it easy in the life. Yeah. And actually he's taking part to a kind of some killers come to his apartment because they think he's someone else, and the whole story is about he wants to to get some money out of this story, and he's going to see the other Lebowski to ask him money, he because the killers actually damage some stuff in his apartment. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Actually, who are the two characters on the the poster, on the image that Uh-huh. It's Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. John Goodman, you have probably seen him in in a series? And and which one is the Big Lebowski on the picture? Mm-hmm. On the right, the guy on the right, Jeff Bridges. Okay, so the guy with the glasses. Mm-hmm. And the one on the left is his friend? Or is that the other Lebowski? Yeah. He's the one coming from Vietnam. The Vietnam guy. Okay. Aha. He is still equipped for war. Hmm. Okay so It's a movie from the nineties actually, yep. But this movie is supposed to happen in what time, From the nineties? And he's still prepared from or still as he would come from the Vietnam. Yep, that's a problem. Okay. I'm going to actually I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie, so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design. There Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Sort of. Oh. So on the left you see the main characters of the movie, so the the hero at the top left. Mm-hmm. Then it's the guy coming back from Vietnam. Afterward it's a guy who John Turturro, they are competing with him on a bowling contest, and Julianne Moore and the last one is Buscemi or something like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Buscemi. Buscemi? Mm-hmm. He's never speaking in the movie. Really? Each time he's trying to speak, the other one are are stopping him. Oh. So it's No, he's not on the on the picture, the second Lebowski. And this one is supposed to be the second Lebowski? Or who Okay, okay. So my proposition was to add the title of course, some information about the pricing on the right but when it will be printed it will be okay, I think. You cannot read it very well because Mm. But actually I'm little bit missing some information about our movie club, I think there should be some more information. Ah, Okay, so I prepared a second one where there is some information. At the bottom we can see that do you know Montreux English Movie Club? I like this, mm-hmm. I said that people can contact us to get to the committee and select movies. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. So. I think it looks too much like a CD cover, though. The text on this one is very good. Mm-hmm. Okay. Because it's square. I like the layout of the first one and the content of this one. Uh-huh. So perhaps we can somehow combine them. But there is a there is a third one. Actually I prefer it because it's more colourful also. It looks like two different posters though. I don't like the black one. The first poster is much too dark. I think there is too many colours, too many colours. No, that's nice. Nowadays, if you see some advertisements on the but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the street, this is typical typical poster I wouldn't look at. But it can catch the eyes actually but then the problem I preferred the first one, because I think it's important to have the plot of movie, especially for a movie people don't never heard about it. Yeah. It's hard to read. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I don't know. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Maybe two or three sentences, because I guess they won't stop in front of the poster. Okay. The paragraph was a little bit long. Yep. Okay, what should I do for these posters? In terms of content. So layout of the first one and colours of the third one. I would and content of the second one. Okay, I'll try to do something, but first anyway we have to select a movie. So I'll put all the information and you want me to put at the bottom, all the information about the committee and the Montreux Club, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Like what you have there. Okay. And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions, not even of the whole plot, but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause I think that paragraph is too long, people don't generally just stand there and then read the whole thing. Okay. Okay. Okay, so just to finish with The Big Lebowski, I think those two images are pretty representative, so on the top you see the hero with a cowboy that introduces the movie, and on the bottom he keeps dreaming in this movie, because the killer's put it or he is drinking too much also, so each time he's drinking he's having some dreams, very very weird, but interesting. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. So the woman on the second picture, that's Julianne Moore or. Yep. Actually, she wants him to she wants to make kids and she's using the Big Lebowski to have kids with him, but he doesn't know. So maybe he's making strange Okay. Ah. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Interesting. So it's not really violent or the movie is quite for general audiences. It's very very sweet and it's like a dream actually. Okay. Okay. How is it actually ranked, because I cannot see it here in your table. Huh. No, it is in the table actually. I somehow can't find it. It's coming at the end. It's here, forty eight. Forty eight. Ah, forty eight. But quite a lot of people have seen it actually. Fifty thousand, mm-mm. At least voted for it. Yeah. Voted. I hope more people have seen it. But generally you vote when you have seen the movie, no? Mm. Okay, so I think we should decide for a movie now. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So maybe each of us can select two movies or Okay. Let's nominate first. Let's nominate, okay. And then we vote we choose from the list. So I will take Schindler's List and I will take The Big Lebowski. One of them is really just funny and from the nineties, the story is from the nineties, while the second one is about the Second War and is serious. Mm-hmm. I'll nominate the one I proposed, Saving Private Ryan, so history, war, drama. But I would like to see it and American Beauty. Mm-hmm. If you think that our series okay, it's not about America, but still Apocalypse. It's about countries. Agnes, Denis? I'd go for Sixth Sense, just because it's different from all the other ones and maybe Shawshank Redemption, just because we haven't seen it. Mm-hmm. Denis, are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something? No, actually I'm happy with the choices, because I would really push American Beauty, because I think it's an easy movie to watch and still there are a lot of things to think afterward. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And it's representative of the nineties, I think. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So what if we voted, say, for first and second choice and then we count? You can give two points to one and one point to another one? Okay. Would you like this strange way to vote? Yeah. Okay, that's but then each of us will but then each of us will vote for our nominees, so I would propose to to vote for to to give the points to the movies that were not nominated by you. Okay, start, Andrei. Okay so if I nominated two and I was the only one, I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty. No I don't want to finish I think I'm going to No. Okay, Okay. You don't want to finish, Denis. Then you'd better hurry. Okay. Okay. Maybe it makes more sense. So then it's more complicated but okay, let's Mm-hmm, okay. That makes the vote more complicated. Okay, so I'll give okay, two to The Sixth Sense and one to The Big Lebowski. Sixth Sense. Okay, me I put two to American Beauty and one to Saving Private Ryan. Okay, So I'll give two to American Beauty and mm one to The Big Lebowski. Kay. I note that you didn't nominate a film, so you are sort of freer than us. Seconds. Agnes? No, Big Lebowski, I nominate. Okay. Okay, and I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The Shawshank Redemption. Okay, so it's pretty clear. So now try to sum it up. American Beauty. So do we have something? American Beauty four, Big Lebowski three. American Beauty. Three. Mm-hmm. So you have to redo the posters? That's the only thing that's worrying me, but it should be okay. Mm. You didn't have that many graphics in the first one. Mm-hmm. So you select you wanted actually me to select the this design? That takes a bit more time, but if you if all of you can send me one image, I can make something on the left. You mean the first poster. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Select one image from the movie With a different title? But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps. Maybe you can leave those. Yes, but of the wrong movie. Mm-hmm. Okay. That's the real twist. No but I'll make something. I'm sure, sorry. Sorry. Leave Julianne Moore. I was sleeping for a while. Julianne Moore actually She's playing in the no? No, she's not. In American Beauty? No, it's who is it? Annette Bening, who's the main character, the main female character, the mother. Ah okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, I'm looking forward to seeing it, I haven't see it, so we have to select the movie for May. Okay we still have to decide for next meeting and we're all set. When do you want these images by? Just quickly. By next Monday. Day after tomorrow? It should be from this period, because nineties would be finished. I think we can meet at the same period. Two thousands. Mm. So we'll try a movie from the two thousands. Two thousand. Mm-hmm. And we can meet at the beginning of May. Yeah. Yeah. So I think Monday is second? No. No, Monday is third already. Third isn't it? Mm whatever. Monday May third? Whatever. First Monday of May. Okay. First Monday of May, so it's after the projection, and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense that we are yes, yes, yes. Yep. How many people we got and Mm-hmm. We can ask people casually, sort of what genre of movie they want, or Start again. And perhaps we will have some new members. But then in June, what are we going to do in June, because we cannot make movies from ten two thousand. American Beauty, finally. Maybe some kind of movies that spans across periods. Or go back to the fifties. I think there is a Godard with a lot of quotations from other movies or let's see when we Let's cross the bridge when we get to it. Maybe. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, see you April twenty ninth, American Beauty. So what's the movie again? American Beauty. Okay. Thank you. Okay.",
