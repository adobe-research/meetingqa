    "displayText": "Oops. That's as far as it goes. Hi guys good morning everybody here. And I want to introduce myself, my name is Shrida Daseri and I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. So I want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here. And what you're drawing? Sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer. My name is Ed and I do accounting. How you spell your name? ED. ED okay. Mm. And? Do you also do marketing? No. So only accounting? Accounting, yes. Okay. And? And I'm Christine, and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer. Mm-hmm. Industrial designer. But I'm not really one. Who is marketing, nobody in the It's you, okay. Marketing is me. So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, we have a long time, just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the project initiation. First of all I want to ask Mister Ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and Mm-hmm but do you already have a functional design or a technical design or for the moment not yet, okay, but what's what's your do you have some project plan, something with you or Mm-hmm. I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to market the product. We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. For the moment not yet. Good question. No, this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. Okay, so when you think you can give me some kind of project plan, okay, a discussion By next meeting, okay that will be great. Certainly by the next meeting. Okay, so there's any questions or first of all about this project? What is the goal of the project? The goal of the project I think maybe I'll hand out to the Ed, okay, so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do. We have to define exactly what our product is, from From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee, is that right? Yes, can you explain what exactly the product is? I think if I'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. I was wondering Mm-hmm. Remote controls, 'cause I had two different things. I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new remote control for television, and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. Yes. So we're have to design something that is very user friendly. Mm-hmm. Something visual that has something that will draw people to buy the product, because I think everybody's experienced with remote controls, and some remote controls are worth throwing out the window. Mm-hmm. Most of them don't. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. And Christine, what about the industrial design plan? Are you have a design already on this product or you're still working on the design? No, I have not begun working on the design, and I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, I thought we were designing a new monitor. Mm-hmm. The website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of some sort of a seven inch monitor, and I understood that that was the project goal. So I'm glad I didn't do any work ahead of time because I clearly didn't understand the project goal. Okay. I just did see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, that's and I read through the different steps, and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps. Mm-hmm. So you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design? For the industrial design? Yes. I would think that depends on how much money you give us. Okay. But before we talk about the finance, okay, do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also. Because you can make it you have different choices with different financial models. I kind of think that in general you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal, and they immediately wanna have one of their own. So really would need to something like the iPod would be good, seems to have caught on fairly well, so I don't care what it does, just so it looks cool. Mm-hmm. Okay, but when you think you can give me a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now and so I'll have to wait and see how those go. If they go quickly then it could be a month. If I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months. But I need something in the writing, like what's your functional design, what's your technical design, and how many people you need for this project, and what's the time frame you're looking, okay, and what is the budget, maybe initial budget you're looking, okay, and how is going to the market, okay, so you've had to meet with the marketing team okay, when are you going to introduce, okay, and by the time you introduce the product and there would be a competition, okay, so I need some kind of the plan in the writing from you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, and it's as soon as possible. And when would you like that? If we have enough time then do you think two weeks is close enough? Yes I think that would be good, because I need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do, and what cost is, okay, and what's the time frame and what's the project plan, because without any documentations, I cannot go to the management and say, so we are going to do this and we need this much money, okay, so then it's difficult for me to say, okay, that's the reason I need some kind of plan from you, initially, okay, then we can have the further discussion again. Are there other people who will be contributing to the plan? Yes, of course, if you need some help, so let me know. Who are the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view, okay, to add in any documentation, or some technical point of view, so just let me know so I can coordinate all the teams. Okay, I'll get back to you on that. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And Ed what do you think about this project for the remote control and do you have already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy? Not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do what they're building, their designs, their ideas, also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. Hmm. Mm-hmm. It should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition, I agree it has to be something new, it has to be something that draws people saying eh, I like this. Mm-hmm. Whether it works or not, they have to first say I like this, I like the design, and then it's gotta be simple to use. Yes, so what I prefer maybe you need to interact more with the Christine, okay, because you know what she is going to do it, okay, and you know how to sell it. Okay, because she is doing the design, but you are the core because you are in the marketing, okay, because you need to sell and you're the responsible for all the money, the finance, okay, tomorrow. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So, what I prefer, okay, so you need to interact with the Christine more and within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design, okay, and you need to come up with some kind of plan, okay, how we are going to do your sales plan, okay, that's Yes, that's you have to decide, okay, so the best thing is both of the Christine and you discuss with yourself, okay, and come up with the cost, and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay. Mm-hmm. Do we already have a cost limit on an idea of we want to market this for, how much it's gonna sell for, that's up to us to decide, eh? Then we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project, okay, how much is going to cost us, and how much we are going to benefit for the company. Okay, of course it's of benefit for everybody individually. Okay, so I think maybe if we can give me some kind of the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the proper project plan. Okay, and if you need any coordination in between compared to maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, okay, depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, okay, so you let me know. Very good. Okay, I can coordinate, or maybe you are my coordinator, am I right? Very good. Mm. Between all the. No, not exactly. My job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that. So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her, so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work, and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in, but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it. Christine. Which is Yes. So basically you need to interact with Christine more, okay, for the user acceptability, okay, and the testing, okay, then you will Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Which will also feed into the marketing, because depending on what users want, depends on how you sell it, what tag lines you attach to it, how you try to make it more attractive to users. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit. And then I guess build the plan based on all of that, because I think you need to take all the factors into account. Yep. But what I request, okay, keep Ed in the loop, okay, in between your meeting and Christine meeting, because he should know what's happening. Of course. We can CC him on any discussions or documents that are passed around. Yes. Okay and please please copy all the mails, okay, all the discussions to me, okay, so I need to submit to the management. Sure. No problem. So any questions for time being? No. So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or okay. Yes. Okay. To come up with the functional design and to discuss with Ed, okay, and how it's going to be work, and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, so then we can discuss about further things. Mm-hmm. Okay. So, we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting. It's okay? Mm-hmm. Thanks for coming. Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could you send us a copy of your slides? Yes, I will. Mm-hmm, that would be useful. Yes. I'll let us keep all the emails and all the copies, okay, share each other, okay, so you know everybody what's happening, okay? Sure. And if anything you need anytime please either you can call me, or just send me email, or just come and knock my door, okay, so I'm available here. It's good? Okay. Okay, thanks for coming and I wish you a nice time then. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Okay, see you later. Bye.",
