    "displayText": "Right first time this time. There we go. It's not that complicated, but I get it wrong every time. Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew. For Matthew, yep. Mm. So I suggest we start the meeting without Matthew he's obviously late for some reason. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Good. Um. Today we will talk about conceptual design. I hope you both did some work concerning a conceptual design. Mm-hmm. This will be the agenda for the meeting. I will take some minutes again. Mm-hmm. We will have the presentations of you different team members, and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented. Yep. Yep. And we have some forty minutes to complete this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You Anna do you have your presentation ready? I'm just making this Okay I'll just email you this file, my presentation. I think the Matthew it's important that Matthew is here because it's really a team project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good. Okay. Ah there is Matthew. Sorry. So. Good. Do presentation ready? Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you. Okay. So I sent you the slides, you didn't see them? So did you manage yes I see him, good yes. Okay. No. So 'Kay. Okay it should've gone through to you. Okay mm yes I have it. Mm-hmm. Okay so this is just a presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment. Can I just put this on? So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it. Um. This is to do this I will not remove my microphone. We basically used some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time, the main results of that, and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment and as part of The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really. The most important by far was the look and feel of it. It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there. It needs to stand out. It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment. Most people find remote controls boring at the moment, we need to have something that looks interesting, that looks exciting, that will stand out. People will wanna buy it. That was twice as important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else, apart from just the look of it. People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want. That's a really cool feature, and it has to make them wanna buy it again. Third on the list, and again innovative was twice as important as this last aspect, it has to be easy to use. So they have to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it. Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment, fruit and vegetables. This is basically talking about just the feel of it, so probably not the smell of it, but the bright colours, eye-catching, really bold designs, and a spongy feel. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I had a talk to the design people about this, but having a remote that's tactile, that feels different, that would be really cool. That would make it stand out. Hmm. Um. So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said? Spongy feel? About the feeling Okay. Make it not spongy is the current thing. You can. Spongy is the current texture, but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all, so if we make it maybe furry or soft or something, that'll be something that sets it apart, rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment. Mm. Yeah. Okay. So as far as the design goes, the very most important aspect was the design, to the customers. So going with the fruit and vegetable idea, we've got the bright colours, so makes it stand out, the oranges and the bright yellows and the florescent colours, part of the fruit and vegetables. Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones, they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers, so they can choose what colour the outside is. That's one way of looking at it. Textured feel we just talked about. Maybe it's another way of doing that. Mm-hmm. So if it's part of the the changeable covers then maybe they can choose a different texture, a spongy one or a soft one or something like that. So they can choose it as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room, or just what they like, their sports team or whatever. That's a very good idea. Yeah. And still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality, the way the keypad looks. Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment. They're big selling items. People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that, and we can start using some of their ideas. Back to technological innovation, not quite as important, but still a big issue. We talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost, that's one thing we could look at. There are other aspects like LCD screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think, in my personal opinion, gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them. Mm-hmm. I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in. And use. I had no real specific ideas for this, maybe we just, the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe, by themselves, and then the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate. Mm. Yes maybe Matthew can give some more information on the Mm. Voila. Yep and that's the presentation. Okay good, that's very clear. Very clear. Yeah. Kay. Um. So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that? Yes we maybe can decide later on the the look and feel of it was a good idea maybe to Yes the the there are changeable covers, but on the other hand I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new line of supplies it would be very complicated organisational. I think you. To let the people choose, you mean? Yeah. We're selling so many units of this. This is gonna be a mass marketed product, we can afford to have two or three different designs at least. Mm-hmm. A set of three, four different aspects. Yes. Mm mm. Mm-hmm. Sure that fits the. Yes and of course we get a if it works we can get after-sales that would be very good those covers could go for three, five Euro. Mm. Mm. That's a very good idea And then maybe we can go a Matthew's presentation Together indeed because you might have some information on the easy to use, what you were already mentioning. Then we could discuss later we can put all ideas together. Mm-hmm. Mm. I agree. It should be easier with that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside. So. So I'll go with that actually Okay so then the idea of having a remote is generally you have different keys and different structures, different forms, and they could be buttons or and they could be of a varying sizes if you want to basically emphasize a particular key more than the other, and maybe you can have different colours for example having the red off switching on and off the button. Mm-hmm. So this this is the general trend to the method they do. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So what I have found was that currently they are mostly that the TV, VCR, music system operated ones actually, and they are very specific to each other, but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the VCR and if you want to follow some soundtrack on the see they have the common thing actually you can have and There is also a speech recognition to store channel information, names, like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality, say TV, VCR or something I say it to the TV and the TV, and you can programme the keys certain keys are even the channel information. Mm. Mm. Mm. I like the idea though of having speech recognition for the name of a channel like BBC, rather than having to remember the number of it on the keypad. So you you can just because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the exact channel numbers exactly, even if you arrange it by however you arrange it, you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to So it it's like it limited one. That's a good idea. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. I really like that idea. What functionalities do you suggest for that? For facing this problem? In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing, eighty word, which shouldn't be that difficult to implement, eighty to hundred word. Mm-hmm. Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control, you want to store your favourite channel. Mm. Maybe ten channels, at the most. Some ten twelve channel information. You don't want to store all the hundred channel information into that. Okay. Mm. And basically it depends the remote with LCD display for browsing because for example you are watching a movie, and you are having a universal remote control and you want to you don't know really which functionality is now, so I am using the TV so every time I use it, it could be for example I can use a simple toggle switch, and a display, press it the display says, okay, I'm in TV or DVD or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys, to model the functionalities will increase actually, and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. You can't. And there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them, and you can operate them. Mm-hmm. So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present. I personally would look at things like having a universal remote, is a good idea, like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having, with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition. Mm-hmm. I got a mail from the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the speech recognition into the coffee machine, and so if you say hello coffee machine, it say hi Joe, or something like that, and you won't be using it, so mm thing, and very isolated word and it is interesting, and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys, on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing, like it could indicate you're it it could indicate what is the whether you have enough battery in your remote, the blinking. Mm But a coffee machine, there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a small vocabulary. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. At the same time, if it's a dark room, it can be used to locate the remote also or you can let them to do that. And okay for coming back to one point you want to let the user to programming the keys? Two thirty five supposed to finish. Some of them? And isn't that too difficult for the we want don't if still want the RC to be easy to use, that's the compromise. Hmm. No but if you give it depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put. Yeah. Hmm. For example I would like to store in certain way, so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think you can do it both ways. So. You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing without customizing it, or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features. A standard. Yeah. Yes but maybe you can give a hand to us because I'm not sure that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents. Yeah. I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity, but it's it's it's the real We have to consider it. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Do we think these ideas and my speech recognition, maybe it's possible for twelve Euro but then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement the the the furry case of the Mm. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm I would say that for programming keys, you said, it could be easily done within the package of twelve Euros, but for the ASR system, I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or Exactly if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented, and how much it's cost, maybe with a cheap chip. Yeah. We can talk with the coffee unit and you can check how much they. Mm. Maybe we can talk to them, and we can come with that. Mm mm. Yeah. And also you can think of having since you have something maybe if you added little bit of display, you might need the to keep checking the battery, so you really need some kind of indicator, so it could be a blinking option of LED it could actually be used to detect also. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. So No actually it tells you it can be for two purposes, like if you have an LCD display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote, which need just six six volt sorry three volts of DC. Mm. I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark, so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Mm. It may need more actually, so you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that, some functionality to indicate the battery limit. Mm. Hmm. It's true. And then if the battery limit is indicated, if it could be indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on how much is the battery, that is good enough to even locate even if you want to. Mm. Mm-hmm. You know. Kay good. So You have time some more? I don't know how if I have time to talk about the Okay. Mm yes I would Yes yes you can still. Yep. We have time. Sure you can. So what I'm gonna present here is very basic knowledge about all the components that are inside a RC a remote control, and how is it manufactured what is the process, just to explain you. Mm-hmm. So the method is there is a set of components in a remote control and what cost the components in themself do not cost a lot but the way to assemble everything costs obviously, and I will show you my preferences at the end. So there are different types of Two different ways of using the components for making a remote control. Nice. Hmm. The basic way is to use an integrated circuit and some transistors that aims at communicating the message and to send the message to the led that will transmit to the receiver. And the other components and the circuit board buttons, infrared, led, etcetera, for the components. So you finding, just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed, and then it translate to the key, to a sequence, something like morse code, with a different sequence for each key, and that's, with the components we will use, we will have different messages, different sequences, and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it's easier to mass produce and assemble. So I think for our design we want some programmable V VLSI or FPGA high technology, and this is important, and also we'll use in any high-tech devices a chip of fibreglass to them and connect them. Mm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So my personal design we need to find a solution what is the material of the cover we want to use. If it's plastic or you said that you had some ideas like fruit, veg or dunno. Mm. Maybe we can give the the case normal a very normal case but, with the changeable covers to fancy it up. Yes. Yes. Mm-hmm. So a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in, for instance, a wooden case. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. Just what Mm-hmm. Mm just have Just the veneer on it. Like they do with cars I think. Inside the car. So they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons, a scroll wheels, integrated push buttons such as a computer mouse. Yeah. And very cheap LCDs, so liquid crystal displays. And the final point okay is there are some compromise to do. Hmm. So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip, but the scroll wheel and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money which is a higher price range alright. And the display requires an advanced chip, which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip, with twelve Euros and if it's made for mm four million items, then I think we could be able to handle that. So to sum up we need so I just said that the list of components has to be listed and assembly is an important process that has to be taken into account. And for the designing of the cover layout then it's better to to maybe see that with the UR URI Expert so that it's really a team-working. Sorry. Mm. Mm. So I cannot design something without your agreement, right? So of course for example I wanted to know a if you want to have the LCD display over there, or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things you'll need inside your inside what Okay. No of course. Yes. It's kind of simple programmable device, and we have to insert. I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions Exactly for customizing and. Okay. Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card. Where they do all the with them actually. Okay. How cost effective it would be to put that chip into it and do the programmable things. Yeah. So I think we should come to some decisions now about this. Good idea. Yeah. So I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip, but when we want a scrolling wheel we also need the expensive chip, so can we use same chip, so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features. Exactly that's a very good idea, we could have one main chip it's called FPGA chip, that could handle both scrolling wheels as well as LCD and. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is possible in the given budget, maybe we should go for the more expensive chip, so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip. Yes. I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro. Do you think that's feasible? You think it's possible. Is it possible to fit in to that? Also I think both if we had a budget of twenty twenty Euros, it will be okay, but. Sorry. Hmm. Maybe we need specific costings then. Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better. That's an excellent idea. Mm yes when you make a design next meeting you can give quite an exact cost price. That that would be a very good idea. Mm. Because right now I don't have price in head but for next meeting I'm sure be able to do that. Mm. Good good. That's something which I wanted to ask you also, what will be each individually the cost of it. Yeah. For example if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood 'cause I think it's much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood. Okay. I agree on that. Mm. Yeah. It will be much much expensive though it's the most natural thing, but. Yes but I think I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition, and then people can fancy it up with more expensive materials which come with another price. Hmm. It's we we can give a preference to them, but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for. Do do you agree? But it's a detailed plastic versus wood, and we need maybe to centre our description on the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user, and maybe with graphs or don't User Interface Designer you could maybe help us on that. Mm sure. Yeah. I think for next meeting you two can present a real design. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. So drawing it on the board. Perfect. And then we now only have to decide the general function. So let's say next meeting you produce two designs, one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price. Sure. We will. Yeah. Mm. Furthermore we go for the basic plastic case which can be later fancied up with additional how do call them, these mobile telephones you can put a cover over it. Uh. Mm. Yeah. But that that that that can be done later. Customized. We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control. Mm. Um. Okay. We can give them smooth keys. Smooth keys with bigger So that The problem most of the time we've seen, the keys is that it's small, and every time we have to be very but if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys, then you can merge them together to you can actually, for example, if see, they are they are quite small over here, and now you can, for example, as I was if you make them big, it may change the look of the thing also to the people. Yeah. Mm. Is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas? Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. At the same time, it would be more interesting for people who are having this RSI and all problem. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yes yes yes big keys is good thing I think. Big keys may better for them actually and. You see? I agree and not too too many keys of course. Yeah. No no. Mm one I've had before, a remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit just, covers half the keys most of the time, and then you can slide the cover back to get to the more advanced keys. Mm mm mm. Mm but then still have when you don't use it you have such a an extent of your remote control which you don't use. Yeah. Mm. So maybe it's possible I don't know whether you can indicate this, that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I've seen that before too. Yeah. It flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath. Yes. Yes. So it's something like the model here you can put the keys. Mm. Mm. But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well. That's what you mean? Yes I that's what I mean so something like a book. Yeah. I like this one. I like the shape of this one. Yeah. Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-rectangular one, so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something. I like also this one. The point is maybe we need also to make a decision on how how big we want to be and how many buttons like we should decide numbers or Okay. Mm. Mm mm 'kay. That next meeting that would depend upon us actually. Is this for the next meeting though? I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting. Mm. Just make two designs, and the we we can decide decide between those designs. Yep. Okay. I think that would be a good idea. Perfect. So any questions for now? No no. No. I don't have. So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting? Yes I come to that Yes maybe I don't know whether that's possible, maybe you can start evaluating their work somehow. Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices, if you're using speech recognition or something like that. Mm. Okay is this me designing a way to evaluate it so Thinking about how to set up test groups and things? I don't know whether that's possible in the given time but as far as possible. Mm. Okay. So you two will be together working on two prototypes and further instructions will be sent to you by email. Yep. Exactly. Mm. Yeah. Two or three prototypes? Two. Two. Two? One for cost and the one with higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or find a compromise between both of them, that's how it is. Mm and then. Okay. Mm. And find maybe a compromise. Hmm. Yes okay. Perfect. Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay let's call this to an end. Mm 'kay. Okay. Thanks guys. Thanks. So we are done for now.",
