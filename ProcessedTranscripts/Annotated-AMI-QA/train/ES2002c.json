    "displayText": "S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is, in that sense so it does kind of make sense. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Okay, Okay. It kinda does make sense, doesn't it, because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background. Yep. Everything I have is kinda background. Okay we all ready to go? Yep. In this meeting then if I'll just recap on the minutes from the last meeting. And we decided on our target group being fifteen to thirty five, and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered, that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into those categories. Yep. Mm-hmm. And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring everything except the TV, and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan. So that was the last meeting. Is there anything have I forgotten anything? Mm-hmm. No. That sounds. Is that everything? Okay. So if we have the three presentations, and then if you have anything to kind of that you're gonna want to discuss, maybe just make a note of it, and we'll have all the discussion at the end. That might be a better idea this time. Sure. And so if we start off with Andrew and then Craig and then David, if that's alright. Okay. Sure. And then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff, right. Yep. Cool. So if you wanna take this. Why don't I get that? Hmm. Screwed in quite tightly. How did we leave it with speech recognition now? We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that? Mm-hmm. Right. I should also point out that the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product. Okay. So that's kind of the end result hopefully. Okay. Alright so is it function F eight? Uh-huh. Hopefully appear in a wee second. Hmm. Come on. I think it's working. Up there we go. Okay great so let me just start this. Okay great. So move on. Uh-huh where'd it all go? It's not good. No. Okay lemme just see where I can find it. This looks more like it. I think I just opened up the template. Sorry about that. Right. Okay alright so let's have a look here. Okay so this was the method that I've taken. Here we go. Basically what I wanna do here, before we get into it too far, is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful. Okay. And then sorta go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information, and then sort of bring us all together into it to sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision. So I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us, and then identify trends that are sort of in sync and are important to our project plan that we have so far, and then initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to narrow in on aspects that will inform other other elements of the project. Does that make sense, that sort of strategy? Mm-hmm. Yep. I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do, so that's why I suggested we get in this. Aye a fair point definitely. Okay so out of different figures and ratings of people consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that the television remote control, a fancy look and feel, okay, and not, it specified, not a functional look or feel, fancy. Okay. However, this is where we kinda have to be very, creative about it. Number two was that it be innovative. Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary sort of functional bits to it. And third priority for ease of use, again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be, quite user friendly while still having technology. So I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of marketing, is that I think what we should think about is about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel, and not so much to the functionality of it. For example when you pick it up and push it it all lights up or something, what I mean, like, or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use. Aye right. Uh-huh. How do you make innovation make something more easy to use? That's guess where we're gonna go with this. Okay. Okay then there's the other aspect of the the market research I have here is on fashion style, okay, which as we've agreed is a priority. Top European fashion trend that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables, okay, especially in clothes and furniture. And when I first saw that I thought do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it, or we get right into it, or we completely steer away from it, do you know what I mean? Okay okay. So my my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend, but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics. cause I think what we're in is partly sort of home decor, partly something like a computer, so I think we might wanna be careful about how quickly we create a remote control in the shape of an apple or something, I think that would be pushing it. And then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of, you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle, which is which also indicated that last year this was this was not the case. So probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode, so if we try and really capitalise on that, I think that'll be in our favour. So this is the summary of everything. Style is number one thing in the market of who we're selling to. Innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be cutting edge, but ease of use has to be insured throughout. That was the number three thing. And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that's the way I interpreted it anyway, softness in materials, shape, and function, and so I've written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion, Mac iPods, something which is, I'd have to say very high-tech, ten gigabytes, whatever, but when you hold it in your hand there's no buttons. Mm-hmm. You know what a Mac iPod is? Mm that's true. I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy, I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it a more of a comfortable type of or more of a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have. So with all that information what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we take these ideas, as we get into the more sort of production side of things, that we think about shape, materials, and themes or series that go throughout. Sort of like a dunno we think of some kind of a theme that unifies it all, that we agree on, sorta like a marketing identity. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon, lime, dunno, green colours, whatever, it's just an idea, 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of what people associate them with in terms of texture, shape, colours, things like that. Mm 'kay. Great. The ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving a theme to it would be lemon or something like that, something which is, like you see a lot in other areas. I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with lemon and lime and So anyway it's just an idea. Okay. Yeah. I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into something which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because something to do with lighting within it. Just within the simple sense, when you pick up a phone and touch a button lights up, usually the buttons light up. Ah. How can we build on that? Maybe it could light up in different colours or something or people could buy the control and then it comes with different covers or something so. Okay. Anyway that's all I have, but hopefully we can revisit those ideas when we get into Yep. That's great. Uh-huh. Okay great. Thank you for that. Craig do you wanna plug yours in then? Is it working? Mm. Not quite. Did you press F eight? It's probably not sending. Yeah. Something coming now. Yep, there it is. There we go. And so think of this concept. To research it I've had a look on the homepage again. It's provided me with more examples of previously existing remote controls. There's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there, so I've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this So then we're looking for suggestions on size size of control and the buttons, the shape of the control, and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control. Mm. What I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them. They're not very attractive to look at, and they're not very comfortable to hold, I just hold 'em like big bricks, and they're very easily lost. They tend to be very dark colours, so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them. Mm-hmm. The controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme. For instance, the stand-by button isn't always red, it really should be. It's something the user then identify with. This is a red switch off, that's how it should be. I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that, but something to look out for. There's a problem that I've got couple of preferences for the end control I get 'em with the red colour button for stand-by and the other examples of that The buttons should be large. They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones. They should be easy to press, very comfortable. One of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V on them, so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button, that's kinda confusing. Mm-hmm. Should avoid things like that. If the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere. Okay. Obviously trying to avoid being tacky there, it could tie-in very easily with your lime and lemon idea. Yeah. Okay, do we have a corporate colour scheme? I didn't know. I think it's yellow because the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow, so yellow, lemon, definitely food for thought there, but keep going and we'll discuss it after. Okay. And the Play-Doh's yellow. Okay. Fantastic. Okay. Any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be hidden, they shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort. Yeah. Mm-hmm. If we did decide to go for voice activation there should always be a button as alternative, possibly hidden in the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice, maybe they got a cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look. That's just wrong. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. And we got an email from it's the the research department, and they've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask it a question. Mm. So it could be good to have them confirm any action you take and possibility. Aye that's a good idea. Right and these are problems I've had with it. I don't know where the slogan should go, or really what the slogan is. I think it's fashion into electronics. Yeah. And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is. You say you wanted the corporate colours, but they don't say if we can use any other colours at all or That's it. Mm. Mm. Okay. Cool. Okay. Great. Lots of good information there. That was very good, and now with David. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. I think I'm cool. It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table? I know it'd be handy, wouldn't it. Just It takes a second, doesn't it? Oops. Do you wanna sit in the line of sight of this. Okay. Let me just get this going first. Ah there it is. Kay, that should be it. Okay I guess the same thing again, I started with something very basic. So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process, and then you can just work through it and we'll either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are. Mm-hmm. The components are exactly the same. Mm-hmm. I think, what you guys said, the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface. The rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity. Like you said time to market was a problem, and how many components are physically in there in cost. And the power is basically a factor of that. And the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, and the infrared, they affect you in terms of the size of your device, and that would have some impact on more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we've said we've defined, we only want the basic things that to be visible, and the rest of them we try to hide. Mm-hmm. So it's just a matter of working out space. So I guess three things, cost, complexity, and the size. These are the three things that will have an impact on you. So just go through it in the components. These are the options that are available to you, I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what the voice options are. Right. It said it could talk to you, but it never said anything about being able to listen. It said something about a sensor but never clarified that. Mm. Hmm. So maybe I could see the other email that they sent you, 'cause they got back to me with different requirements, or different offerings of what components Okay so your basic components are buttons, okay and you have a wheel available, like a mouse scroll wheel, okay there's an LCD display, I think these are quite standard things. Right. Mm. Mm-hmm. They're standard, aren't they? No they're in the sense that these are all the options available for you. I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later. Yeah. Okay then there's how the case actually looks. It can actually be flat or it can be curved, and then the different types of materials that you can use, I don't think you can use them in a combination, but I could check back for you, but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination. Mm-hmm. You couldn't have plastic and rubber? I think plastic and rubber would be fine, but plastic, rubber, and wood, I'm not very sure about the titanium. Yeah. They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium. Hmm. Mm 'kay. The rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use, but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing, so I think that there is some restriction on I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together, wood and titanium, but it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. As opposed to two. Mm-hmm. And the other components are logic chips, again I'll go back to the component chips. How complex or how easy the logic is, it depends on how many functions you have on the unit and that impacts cost. I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Power consumption should be about the same. I think the main impact is complexity, and the other thing is the power options. Hmm. The first one is a standard battery. Okay the second one is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing, it's a crank. I'll clear one of these things for you. Just by moving it. Hmm. But that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources. I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing. Mm. No. Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell, which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead. Yeah. So like what I said, you probably need a battery and something else. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the kinetic one guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think. Mm. From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing, it's a shake it it doesn't work, shake it, knock it or something. Mm-hmm. You had those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it lights up and it goes, that might be a gimmick combined with rubber. Yeah. Hmm. I see. Yeah. Hmm. If you get frustrated remote control you can throw it, kind of just so. Yeah. Hmm. I know what you mean. Okay from my role, don't that personal preferences but role preferences, something comfortable to hold, small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't, like a phone or something, too small phone. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the other thing is from a production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit. Mm-hmm. And also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions. The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features, like the buttons are standard okay, the LCD panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic. Mm. The case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels. Okay with the titanium case, let me just check that titanium case can't be curved, it has to be square. Okay. Okay there's no restriction on the plastic, and it can't be curved on the wood. It can't be curved. Okay. So I don't think you can use them in a combination, especially the titanium I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need. Okay. Right. So mixing them may not be a good idea yep. Okay. I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but you ask away. That's it. Question on can I ask a question? Okay. Can we power a light in this? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light? I think we could because the LCD panel requires power, and the LCD is a form of a light so that Are you thinking of a light in the sense of a light light, or a light in the sense of it glows kind of Frankenstein, it's alive. Mm. Okay. So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery. Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of? I'm thinking it might be That for this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power, and to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is, can the battery power it? Uh-huh. Yeah. Illuminate the buttons. It glows. I'm thinking along the lines of you're in the dark watching a DVD and you find the thing in the dark and you go like this, and that's what everybody does. Okay. Where's the volume button in the dark, and you just touch it, or you just pick it up, and it lights up or something. Okay. A phone like the backlight in a phone. Okay. A phone. Okay cool. Whereas with phones, people charge them once a week. Yeah. We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days. That's why I think the option of the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it a watch, an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it. But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller? Mm. Right. So you could trigger that to a light, like I said the bouncing ball thing, or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up, right, and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness. Sure. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Right okay let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start, and just giving an idea on the time, we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most. Okay, great. Okay. So just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the concepts of the product. So back to your idea about incorporating the idea of fruit and veg, and the corporate colour, and things like that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Does anybody have any ideas about how we can fit all that in together? That's kind of the user interface type of thing, what are your thoughts on that? I think we could go for maybe not a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. You could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit. So maybe are we thinking something that could sit in your hand comfortably, or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or So something quite curvy? Probably something that sits in your hand comfortably, sort of feels right in your hand. Okay right okay. Colour-wise was it you or I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it, was that about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much. I think he made that. What's that? Yeah. And when the corporate colour is yellow, maybe we could think about the colour of the whole product being yellow don't. Okay. And then obviously the materials when it has anybody got an overall picture in their mind about what might work? I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts, and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel. That's all. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. Maybe what we could do is think about a concept which touches back on the colour, said company colour yellow. Mm-hmm. If we think of something, like I was saying also lime and lemon what can we come up with something where we try and associate it with the series. Mm-hmm. We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things. Okay. Right. Is there a particular shape that you're interested in? Does marketing have any research on does it need to be long? Does it need with a square thing 'cause that will help narrow down the choice of fruit. Circular in shape or Choice of material. Yeah. Cause I I was kinda thinking about as well how you get these shock resistant mobile phones, and they're plastic but then also have rubber on the outside, and it feels kind of warmer to the touch. I'm thinking fruits in my head, but that's tacky. See I'd quite like a sort of snowman type shape. It feels a bit more comfortable, and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it. Yeah. And then we could have curved shapes, 'cause wood or titanium, it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that so do we really want it in the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either. No no no not at all. It's more just that we think about what it is we're trying to achieve, so and then we have one sorta theme that we stick with. Do you know what I mean? Okay right so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing. A snowman shape? So a sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need. Uh-huh. That's quite a distinctive shape, that would be good wouldn't it. Right, sure. Yeah. So should we go with that? Can we like to and Can you just we can visualize it. Do you wanna draw it on the board? Something like that you got two groups there maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or you have volume controls about there. Okay. Ooh that'd be good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. So call it the snowman-shape trademark. That's cool. And colour-wise what does everybody think? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere. Do you want the whole thing yellow, maybe yellow and white do you want something Uh-huh. Mm. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if this here, had a sorta background yellow, and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons. Okay cool. And also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in? The fact that it talks to you, it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says, what is it, putting fashion into electronics or something, I dunno. Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere. I think that might scare me. I I any thoughts on that at all? I think that'd probably scare me. You turn it on your control possessed. I know. If you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an LCD display, where would we put that? Would we put that on the inside or It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot, I would've thought. Nah. Do we need an LCD display? What what's the functionality of that? But the question is we achieve from it? What would it achieve? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an LCD panel just to make it glow is a bit of a Mm-hmm. LC when you used to mention the LCD I'd think I wonder what that would be about. And the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings. So as you scroll through, 'cause we said we might have a jog dial, so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is. Yeah. I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it, so it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday. Right, okay. Mm that's true. Yeah. So so no need for an LCD display? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm not saying there's no need for an LCD display, but what would it tell the user, 'cause the LCD tends to be an output as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user? I think that would make it very complex. Yeah. Yeah. Mm not Mm-hmm. We have the option of the speaker as well the the same thing goes for the speaker, is there a need for the remote control to to talk back? I would say no need for a talk-back. You could put a game on it. Does anybody disagree with that? No. No? Easy. When the TV dies you can play with the remote control. Mm mm. Okay right so you're gonna have the three different sets of functionalities, do you wanna group them into head of the snowman, body of the snowman, inside of the snowman, is that what you're thinking? I think the advanced ones the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside. Okay. I think we had were fairly basic ones, they'd have to go on the front somewhere. Okay right what else do you need to talk about? I was just. Where would you physically position the buttons? I think that that has some impact on on many things. Yeah. I think so. Maybe you wanna draw onto the Yep. So I'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about. God we've got five minutes okay back we go. Energy what do you think that's suggesting how we're powering the thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery, but have kinetic power, what does anybody think about that? Sure. I've had kinetic things before, and the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it, and watches Sure, okay, right, okay. No, like I said we have a hybrid kind of thing, so it's not gonna charge the battery, it's just. Okay. Support for it. It's just worth pointing out because I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time, and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery. Mm-hmm. I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time, and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time. Yeah. Yep. Remote control is similar, you're away on vacation, dunno something, and it just starts to get worn down. Yeah. So we should think about. I suppose that if you're away and you're not using it, then you're not using any power either. So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly, we don't have as much time as I thought. Yep. So I think that's what energy is referring to here. Chip on print, is that that's an industrial design thing, is it David? Yes yes. Okay as for the case, kind of discussed that I know we're gonna have rubber buttons that feel kind of Okay. And this size here, I'd suggest this be small, quite small. Just a lot of the one of the things running through my mind right now, I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made, but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech, rubber buttons plastic frame, it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're using to achieve those goals? Okay so backlighting, that would be good. Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that. Or even a clear case. A glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable, but in the dark it's alive. Clear, that'd be Okay. Aye that would be a good idea. Sure. In a slight subtle way. So slightly transparent case, so it's tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it. That'd be really good. Yeah. Yeah. Is that what you mean? Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse. Sure. You have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right. So the battery in that sense, maybe you have one or two strategically placed lights that sort of but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow, doesn't make it freaky. Yeah. Sure. They emanate a light through it. Okay. Lights. Kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And then the other thing that we're we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity, and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some kind of an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled, 'cause that's the main thing people will wanna do. Mm. Could we use a jog dial, a nice just sort of round, somewhere on it where you just roll it? The question is when you're rolling it, how do you wanna roll it? Or. Do you want 'em to roll it like that? Do you want 'em to roll it like that? Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it, whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. If you are holding it in your hand you could do that, couldn't you? Why don't we do it like a mouse then? If you're holding it in your hand you could Do? That's a very unnatural motion to. Okay. Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot. It might work for volume, and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that, but not for channels right. Yeah. Mm. If you have a Telewest box you don't have to buy all the channels, you've about fifty channels, can you imagine trying to. Mm-hmm. Okay okay. Yeah. Sure. And I don't think having that too slow it's confusing to the dunno. Mm. But then for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to skip the channel button, the number part. But users tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of. Yeah. Okay. But. Okay. But that's not a bad thing is it? Just Okay right wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly. Because when you think about it, the alternative is to go push the button. Jog dials are much easier than that. You just roll. Actually, I think they're very quick to use. Yeah. Yeah. So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all? No. And the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing? If if we keep coming back to this board here, I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea, imagine that, it's within the shape of the hand, it's quite small I dunno. Uh-huh. Uh-huh ooh okay, we really gotta wrap up so. Yeah. It's small, and that we've got the slogan somewhere on the casing at the side, and that isn't that what we just said said we just have to decide now? Okay if we can do that, great. Okay. Let's try and get the slogan on there and Mm. Yeah. A And then a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it dunno here, with the It would get bumped, it's doesn't really fit with your hand. So you wanna expand the shape of the That might have one problem in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in. Yeah. Or maybe just fit it down the middle here. Mm. Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly? Okay. Right I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're actually over time. A jog. It's kind of. Is there anything anybody's unsure about? Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes, and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing, I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that. So that'll be good. Huh. And I'll get the minutes up as soon as possible. Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing? I think the jog dial, just after you drew that, what if it was flat and you just spun it, that'd be great. I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing that's what I was thinking a slide, because then you don't have to put the hand. Yeah. Yep. I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward. There's lots of space for it but it's also a marketing and a function. Okay. That's kind of a design thing that you guys can discuss. Sure, and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber, didn't we, and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons, 'cause that'd just be so standard. Okay. Yeah. To make something flush with the case? Something a bit more flush, or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well, so that it has and also plastic I've seen can get really textured, so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand. Okay right. Okay. Kinda grippy? Feel like fruit. Okay. Fruits kids. They feel kind of like you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're actually just plastic that's textured, kind of a little bit like Okay. No. Kinda like that. Okay I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time. So that's really good, like we've had much to talk about that pretty much run out of time to do so. So off you go and design stuff wooh. Okay. Play-doh time. Quite jealous actually. You got to choose first. No, we're kidding. Okay, can I just swipe your power cable, I don't think it matters. Okay lemme okay, I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left. It's you. Argh. This is a real hassle and a oops. I'm gonna take the microphones, 'cause it's too lazy take them off again. Cool.",
