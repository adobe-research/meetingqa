    "displayText": "Alright? Alright. Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the design group. I think we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our new remote control. I'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting. The the problem with existing remote controls, we felt, was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better. They've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn. And people lose them. And We thought that for our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy, that we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons, and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that people use. That we want to go for a long lasting battery that we guarantee for the life of the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable, as a trendy remote control, and B as a Real Reaction product. So that when people are happy with that, they will want to buy everything else from us. Okay. So again we'll have the three three presentations from the the three of you and then we'll make a final a final decision. And the decisions that we need to make today, finally, are what energy source we want to use, whether it is practical to use a a long lasting one. And I think our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for a long lasting power supply, then basically it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down, we'll give them another one. And it'll be prominently displayed as part of the advertising literature that it's guaranteed for life. Now the the internal chip and this is where I need Kate's expert advice and given that this has to go to market as quickly as possible do we go for a custom designed chip? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves? I'm I'm not an expert on these things, but presumably, there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify. But that's that's your area of expertise. And then the the overall design of the case is is Kendra's field and we had some discussions last time as to how we might go forward and we'll finalise those today. And this is all linked in with the the user interface, whether we go for voice, buttons, or a bit of both. And then for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the look, feel and design, Kendra how the user actually uses it and Andrew of course the product evaluation. And Kate and Kendra will be producing a model for us to look at. So, if we can have the three presentations again please, perhaps you'd like to start. Okay. Kate. There we go. I'm sorry, sorry. Kay, I'll just be talking about the components design. And Okay, basically I just looked at what exactly do remotes do. Basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the TV. The materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode transistor or resonator, two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor. Um. Basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a connection within the remote that allows the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format. This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then changed into a infrared light which is sent to the TV and sort of seen by the TV and which changes the channels. Um. Oh. Cool. So as for how we should end up using this in our remote couple of main questions are the buttons. The fewer buttons you have, I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need. However to not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost. That's something we should think about. Also we have to work within the company constraints, and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it. Also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use, so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea. We also need to look at the chips, custom-designed versus off the shelf, and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have agreed upon. However that's gonna cost more, but off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it's gonna allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster, but it's going to be less flexible with the features, especially things like voice activation, which haven't really been used much on remotes, so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to convert, so if we were definitely gonna go with the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip. And that pretty much sums it up. Okay, so how sorry, can you just put that one back up again, please? Mm. Yep, sorry. Yep. Um. Okay, inevitably a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive. Mm. Do we know by how much? I don't actually have any price information, no. And do we know how long it'll take to develop a custom chip. It a lot longer than an off the shelf chip. The problem is the the voice technology is not really highly developed, it's sort of still still in an experimental form, so it's hard to predict the time. Right, okay. Right, I think we need to make a decision here. Given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply, that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology. Mm. Now before we go round everybody else, does anybody have anything to say about that? I I just have a question about that. Does it make a difference if there are just a few commands, for example if you can pre-programme in numbers one through ten and pre-programme say, nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say BBC four as your channel one, as your favourite, it's to have a certain number of favourites and that Okay. Just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick. Once you've got the whole voice chip in there, then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit, but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working. Then it doesn't matter. Okay. Okay. Cause I must say I find it slightly surprising given that, mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling. So for slightly different no, if you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you, this this information is from is this is the internal company information, is it? Yeah. Bits of it. So mm true, again but if it's without any price informations that's difficult to decide. Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive, hundred and fifty pounds or something. Yes, as well. As opposed to the twenty Euros, twenty five Euros. Yeah. Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them, not just that, so. Mm. That's right. It's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive, you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is. Yeah. But we don't know. Um. I mean given that the technology is not well developed and given that it's never been done before, the double risk, perhaps we ought to stick to buttons, since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work. Um. Thoughts? Another thought sorry, go ahead. I was just gonna say maybe it maybe we can cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost. Do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project? I guess it's something we've discussed since the sort of the beginning, so I think in our in our minds it's fundamental, but I don't know that the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that, so I think you have to Hm. I think we Mm. Okay. I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it, then maybe we should have it for the whole thing. I I I I think that's. Mm. And we've been talking about it the whole time. Mm, mm. Anyway, I'm I'm kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it. Mm, right, okay. Mm. It's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative. Yeah. From my presentation show, so. It should be Right, okay, so. Technologically innovative. No, that sounds good. Fine. Okay. Mm. It will have voice recognition if that means if that means we can't afford buttons but second question, do we need the five buttons for channel change, up down, volume up down and on off, just as a backup or just so that people can just sit there pressing buttons? Mm. Okay. Cool. I would say we do. Yeah. I think so. Right. Okay. Sorry, did you want to say anything? Nope, that was it. No? Okay. Shall we move rapidly on to Kendra? Okay. Okay. Rapidly move the cable over. Let's see. Mm. Good. Oh. Yes. Is it gonna work? It's thinking about it. Mm it'll get there. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so I did some research on the internet and what the user interface are just aspects that are seen by users, commands and mechanisms for the operation, and there're just kind of a variety of choices. Findings, so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual. Mm-hmm. There're some special ones available, like this one right here, which is marketed towards children, different designs, and one of the things that we need to watch out for is a V in volume because people Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like. Mm. Uh-huh. Alright. So just kind of minimise the clutter, avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button, like you have on a mouse, that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume, for example, have the slide button on the side, and then you can pre-programme the channels, the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Sorry if I can interrupt you. kay, do you wanna say anything about slide controls? Mm. I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're simple, cheap and reliable. I think they're about the same cost really. I mean, I think the there's a lot of slide buttons out there. I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection. Okay, fair enough, fine. Mm. Just because I for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing. Mm. Yeah. Good, good. Yeah. So three three there's three buttons on a slider. Three buttons, channel up down and Uh-huh. Yes, yes. If you if you got a channel up down, we can have a slider in that as well. Because if you if you notice on the thing it kind of has got kind of if you it kind of sticks, if what up one unit, if you see what I mean. Yeah. Mm. So it kinda goes up one, then you can keep rolling it up, but it's like like a cog or something. So you kinda take it up one at a time. Okay. The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons, on one side for the channel, and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand, and you pick it up, it's easy to know, okay, this is just the volume and this is the channel. Oh. Mm-hmm. This one on the one side and one. You could as a mouse you could the shape of it almost like a mouse, with a dunno depending on the final shape of it, 'cause dunno, it looks like you can control the volume with your thumb, and then you could control the buttons with your fingers. cause I've definitely picked up remotes and meant to change the channel and turn the volume, or vice versa, so it'd be kinda good to have them feel completely different. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You'd know what you were fiddling with. Yeah. Or this is what we have to come up with is the actual shape that people can instantly pick it up and know know what it's going to do. That was. Mm. Okay, so we're looking at sliders for both a volume and channel change of one sort. I was thinking kind of just for the volume, but what do you guys think? Just for the volume. Mm. We could. cause in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and that for rolling, just the way it would Mm. Fingers. It's It it it seems to me that it also has the advantage that it the two are clearly different, that there's no possibility of confusing the two. Yeah. Yeah. So okay. I'm just gonna pass this along. Right so that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the okay, fine. Yes. Yeah. Mm right. Here we go. Right. This is my report on trend watching. Mm-hmm. The data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer. And we got reports from Paris, Milan on new fashions. And the most important aspect is the look it has to look fancy, look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel. Mm-hmm. I was gonna say twice as important as the second aspect, which is the technologically innovative side of it. Mm. And the third being easy to use is probably a given, we have to try and incorporate, so exactly. I I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those. Yeah. Mm. Okay. I that out of sequence? Sorry. And from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes, et cetera. Oh. Sorry, clothes, shoes and furniture and a spongy material to be used on the outside. Uh-huh. Mm I hadn't thought of that, that's different, certainly. Mm. Yeah. But I was gonna say fruit and vegetables, important to this year important to furniture, I'm just gonna say fashion if it looks fancy, then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through. What? Yeah. Mm-hmm. But fashions don't last very long. That can kinda tie into our changing face things, like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year, we can have the face plates. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. We can have a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and A kind of. Uh. The kind you get on hand weights. That kind of spongy. Mm, that weird dunno what that is, but. Uh. Mm. Also means you can drop it without damaging it. It's good as well. That's cool. That's true. Mm-hmm. We could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself, could we have a cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? With interchangeable covers, could just buy a new one every year, a new one when new fashions come out. Yeah. Mm. I mean its I that's an interesting idea, it's like the old Swatch watch where only batteries ever got changed in those, 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion, but it's just never been seen as a fashion item before. Mm. Yeah. Yes if if they're made in sufficient quantity we can but my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last, a long time. What if we included the batteries in the cover? I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one, because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. But if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it's it's even better. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. So can I see that thing? I like that. That all also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and. Um. I know the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability, whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that the whole thing is all, completely soldered together and it it total reliability, but I I I know what you're saying and understand where you're coming from. Just this as examples. So I guess that's true. Mm. But more than just the battery, a complete different you've only got this bit's the bit you keep, and this is the expensive bit, this is the chip and this is the microphone. Mm-hmm. And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees. And then you probably are right. I I think if we're gonna go down that route, then we're talking about even if it costs slightly more than that, just building the whole thing in one, then getting cheaper production costs and, giving people the option of buying a a complete new thing, the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all, it will still work totally. Mm. That's true. Mm. Then if, people lose the cover, they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a new one rather than a complete new remote. Yeah. That's just it with the covers, you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product. Yeah. It's up to it's up to it's it's up to our marketing people to to turn it into a fashion item. Just another five Euro to get Right. So. Yeah. Mm. Mm. And, as external fashions change, then we get new new covers on the market and, readily available. Mm. Yeah. And that's right. And that's the sort of thing, once you get the mould set, you can just whip out different colours, different pictures very very quickly. They have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours. Exactly, exactly. Yeah. Okay. So okay. Right, sorry. It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me. Don't worry it's all said, I was just gonna say are we gonna make this as a part of the it the fashions apply to furniture, so are we gonna make this part of the furniture? Mm. Mm-hmm. This is fashionable. Yeah. This is fashionable with. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm with it, I'm up to date. And the design that I've got, and it could be a home-made design, this says a television remote control, this is, a fashion accessory. So the the basic shape is given that we've got one on off button presumably, two buttons for channel change and one slider and basically nothing else, we need to decide on just the basic shape of the thing. Mm. And, know whether we go down the fruit and veg route, and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana, but know sort of the organic, curved look, to deliberately get away from the the the square look of most current remotes and, whether the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow. Mm. Mm 'cause the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people looked at it and say right, that's a Real Reaction remote control, I want one of those. I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought you'd have a yellow circle with the RR in it somewhere on it, but yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the thing no, but just white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour. The or I'd. An. Yeah. No I I agree, we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the corporate logo prominently. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. And make that a fashion symbol as well. I was mm kinda picturing maybe a shape that's almost like a mouse. This is the whole point, yes, I've got a remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or whatever. And then people, demand more Real Reaction stuff. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. So that, when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it, but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power, wherever, somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. That was just an idea that I had. I've. No my idea was something probably a bit fatter than this but sort of that sorta shape so that you can just sort of hold it. Yeah. Maybe. You'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause a mouse you're kinda just resting on it, you want something you can definitely grip. Kind of a. It's it's sort of a mouse, but held, so you sorta hold it in your hand like that, and fiddling with the buttons. So maybe it'd be. Sort of a combination. Yeah. Yeah. And fiddle around with it and press it. So kind of maybe a little wider than this, 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold, and then if you had then wider up here. Maybe almost like a hairbrush, you could get about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle. And then it would have a wider thing to have the infrared light at the TV and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever, up up the top or something. Yeah. Mm. Cool. What do you guys think about that? I'm suddenly realising that we're discussing how good it's gonna be to change channels we still can just tell it to. Okay. Are we starting to get away from the voice functionality of it? Yeah. It's a very good point. It is a very good point. Yeah. I think we I think we decided that we're actually going down both routes. Yeah. That we we need the manual controls and that they should be of that form, but that. Yeah. But do you know, this shape also kind of lend itself to voice 'cause if you're holding it and you're fiddling, but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque. Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it. And just say I suppose I So I guess we could have a menu button as well. Maybe we like we're leaving out the buttons for the less frequently used stuff, but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice. Mm. I my personal view is that if it's not there, people wouldn't use it anyway. Mm I suppose, but there is the off chance that, the brightness is wrong on your TV or the contrast needs changing. It's certainly possible but we we're going beyond given the state of the technology we want something that we know will work. Mm. You can still incorporate the voice with less buttons. If the power button was also somehow a menu button you could press that or do voice commands, and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options and you could scroll through brightness and and then you can minimise the buttons and still have those, brightness and tint and stuff. That's a good idea. Yeah. We're I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available. We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume. So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume. Okay, if we're going down that route, then we need some sort of display. Do we need some sort of display? But the television would be the display that things like that usually pop up on a you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have tint brightness, and you'd use the scroll, scroll through it. That's on the TV. We actually use the television, okay. And then press that might work. Okay, okay, okay. Onto a mouse, the scrolling button, is actually a button as well, you could press that and have it as a menu button. Yep. That's true. I never understood how that worked though, but. It's like it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it. Mm. You just press it. And you could just click that to so if you had the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select. Mm. Yeah. You know what I mean? Mm. Okay, we got five minutes to go in this meeting, so I think we've actually very conveniently just come to a good point to sum up. Okay. Cool. So Kate and Kendra now go away and play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough, whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic. Play with play-dough. Hmm. And actually put what we've discussed into something was gonna say concrete, but that's a slightly inappropriate word to something that we can see and Andrew can go away and think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not just a a simple remote control. Can I just get some things clear just for my sake. Certainly, of course. Our energy source is gonna be long term. I think we decided that we're gonna for simplicity of, manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a long term battery source on the basis that if we're going for making it a fashion statement, then people are more likely to change it anyway before it runs out and make an assumption that we can aim for a battery that will last most people for we'll say at least five five ten years and that we will guarantee it for five years. Mm. Cool. And we're having a custom chip? Yeah. We're having a custom chip, but the we've cut the functions down, that will hopefully not be too problematic, but given that technological innovation is important, then we need to, I'll say it again, technologically innovate. And we know, we must resist any efforts to try and water that down. And interchangeable case? Interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept. Mm. It should be cheap, if we avoid any, electrical connections. Mm. Yeah. And if we can come up with some way of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want, then this is totally new. Mm, mm-hmm. We don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not, but if they've at least got a good selection of covers that they can use anyway, and if we can keep them, rolling, then so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to any of the famous supermarkets, I won't mention any mention any names, it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better. And are we gonna have it being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or Cool. That that's no, because we've got so few buttons that actually makes that redundant. I think so too. Mm, does actually. And especially for making them so different and. Mm different to feel. And that solves one of the problems of battery life, 'cause that would clobber the battery life, so no, given the nature of the buttons we're having, it's actually unnecessary I think. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Are we having it that it's any angle, or is it just As wide as possible. As wide certainly wider angle than current, so that if you're holding it, anyway like you're likely to and it will work most of the time. Yeah. Like this or like this. Mm. Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the the television doesn't work. I I sorta envisaged that if this was the thing, then sort of the whole of the top would be the infrared. Kinda like this whole So you could use like this and it would go. Mm-hmm. Mm. So 'cause the reality is they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it, the chances are, so if they're holding it anyway, they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it, then that's the sort of coverage that we want. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, we're all clear where we go from here. Yep, sounds good. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay, so thank you very much indeed and I'll see you all again in thirty minutes. Kay. Okay. Kay.",
