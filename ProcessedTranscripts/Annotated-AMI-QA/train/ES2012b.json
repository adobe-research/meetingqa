    "displayText": "Okay, welcome to the second meeting of this design group. I'll briefly go through the notes of the last meeting just done in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals, because we're working strictly as a team here and nobody's working equally, so. Sorry. We we saw that the problems with existing remote controls were a boring shape and boring colour. And we saw that what we needed to do was to make sure the device controls several items, that switching was easy, that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular, that it need to be contoured to make it interesting, that the keys might be concave, simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of. Should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it, illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms. And that people might want it as in addition to their existing remote controls. And that it should just always work, whenever you mm use it. And that it shouldn't be too small, mm that it gets lost. Um. Now I'll shortly ask for three three presentations. Before I do that, however, I will go through some new project requirements that the management have placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting. The the management has had it's own thoughts on this and they don't necessarily agree with what we thought. And then as a result of that we will then talk through the functions that we see the device actually carrying out, and we have forty minutes to do this in and I Anyway. Okay. Now, the new requirements are the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the rise of the internet. And they want it only to cover televisions. Now, what is not quite clear from their directive is whether they mean they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover, videos, DVDs, satellite boxes, which we saw as being fundamental to the exercise. The actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only. And on that basis I think we need to bear that in mind, but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they don't look at teletext anymore, they certainly do look at other things. The device has to incorporate the company logo and colours. The logo being at the bottom of the screen there, the the two Rs in grey against a yellow background. Now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the market. But do introduce some constraints as to how we might do that. It also has to be simple, which to some extent goes along with the first one, and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway. But they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, which mm is is their choice, but we need to talk that through. Okay, so after the meeting it'll be summarised and notes sent out and etcetera. Okay, so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody. Again there is no order of precedence here so I I'll leave it up to you to who who thinks they would like to go first? I don't mind. Fine. Can I steal the cable? Sorry, you can indeed. Cheers. I got a how do I start there? If you click on the one that looks like a projection screen, no the one to the right of that. That one. That one. Cool. These are functionality requirements from our our guys down in the research lab. Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see. Everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff. And general opinions about current current remotes. See that, as we kinda noticed, seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly. So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly. Along with looking less ugly, if it looks better, eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it. Which is a plus for us, if we can make it look better, it'd be more cost effective and we can put the price up. Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user. I kinda take that to mean as they don't they, they only use they only work for the television or as in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system, a digital box, a DVD player, a video player and TV. If it was my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour. Again, seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot. I took to mean that they just they use it a lot, they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume. And I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons, 'cause if we got a remote we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext, and we're going to see that some of the functions like audio settings aren't hardly ever used and used aren't considered relevant by the user. So I think maybe fewer buttons, which also make the design look sleeker, dunno. And frustrations of people losing remote control. I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the TV or maybe it would have to incorporate, but some kind of system where you can use something else to find the remote control. Mm. Maybe it'll beep or something. And yep, the time taken to learn new remote controls don't want to make it easy to use for new first time users and stuff. And repetitive strain injury, I suppose we should make it more comfortable and possibly even use have to make it, fewer buttons, like I was saying about the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable. Maybe don't even have to hold it as such. Mm. Gosh, must be some telly addicts out there if they get RSI from their television remote, is all I can say. But. It also asked if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would. And there was another section on the report for LCD displays, but the data wasn't there, so. I don't actually know what the results for that were, so. Mm. Right. Mm. May be incrementally emitting, but. I must say that I can't remember what phone service I was using the other day, but that had sorta speech recognition which worked remarkably well, so that is indeed a thought and it cuts out I was gonna say, you can't get a lot of RSI, just get jaw ache. And it would cut out the RSI as well so possibly possibly something could add into the design. Okay, sorry. I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation. Um. You see this okay? Almost no? It's sorry it's a bit. I'll read out to you. People's opinions on functionality, the relevance to the remote and how often they're used. So the power. Using the using the the power switch to switch on TV is a high relevance of nine, but it's not frequently used. You see what I mean? Whereas channel selection, which is very high relevance is used the most. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use. Maybe a folding ledge or something. So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings, which are low relevance and rarely used. Mm. And keep the volume selection and channel selection very easily. Mm-hmm. It could be I was just gonna say maybe the flip phones that they use? Have you seen the new mobile phones that flip out and they have the texting, and then the numbers on one side, so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something. Mm. Mm. Mm. The one that slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath. Uh. Yeah. Should we actually bite the bullet here? Mm. If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all remove them altogether. Just remove them completely? That might Maybe have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the TV and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are, you won't lose it. We could actually have we could actually have a remote control with I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, given that now the the age structure we were looking at we had usage by age structure, what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups. Now do we know whether they no sorry forty five to fifty five age group, to put myself right in the middle of it, use remote controls to a great extent. Yes That would've speech right. No this pay more for speech recognition. So, we're looking at again, we don't know the relative numbers in the age groups. That's true. If we wanted something different, truly different, then the buttonless remote control would be it. The only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new remote controls. If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing, that's gonna be quite a change. But if you just lift it up and say, channel one or BBC It I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the, sound from the television, because if somebody actually on the television says ITV and you're watching BBC then it might change itself, so it probably needs to possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it. It might Mm. Or you could even just have it left on. You could just put it down once on your TV and never have to. Mm. No. Yeah. BBC one. Oh. Yeah. That's true. Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. And then just say, I don't know, a thought and then that would certainly be truly different. Yeah. cause audio settings, nought point eight percent. If they weren't there, would people miss them? Mm-mm. But look at the importance of them. The volume settings. Relevance of two out of ten. Volume, yes we need to identify things that people actually need and it's a function of frequency and relevance. Yeah. They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used. Yeah. And I would say ignoring power for the moment, the channel and volume and given that we've been told to ignore teletext. Mm. Yeah. Channel and volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential. Stand out. Um. So if we can design something that looks interesting, or looks different, incorporates the logo and the colours we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey, and dunno, buttons or buttons as an option. I just had a thought actually, sorry to interrupt. Do, please. You were saying about it could technical problems of someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have an activation word. Mm-hmm. Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before, where you just you address the remote, you address the computer, and then give it a command. You certainly could. Mm. Depends whether if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say BBC one. I see. I see. Okay, you could actually print it on the device itself. Mm-hmm. Um. I'm just thinking of the point of view of you could still lose this remote. This I that's always gonna be a problem I think. Mm. And I I so I suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one. Anyway, sorry, carry on. Do you want to just carry on with or no no, no I was in the middle of your report there. No I interrupted you, sorry. Okay. I was just kinda wrapping up there. I was thinking maybe such things are relevant. Mm okay. I think the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better, combined with decrease the or take out the limited functions that we don't really use much. Alright take out teletext, but as for channel settings and stuff it might turn some people that want the whole functionality away. But, since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality. Mm-hmm. We could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it 'cause we're Certainly could. We could. We could even have it as the buttons control this and the voice functions control the things that you would do all the time, so. So if we could power on and channel selection and volume selection, wouldn't have to really and probably it would look better as well. Mm. The the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper. No, it certainly opens up the possibility for making it visually very distinctive. Yeah. cause it does not have to be a oblong box. Yeah. Mm. Lined with numbered buttons and that's everything. Mm. Okay, who sorry, have you finished there Andy? Yep, yep. Given that we've already had a extensive discussion. Okay I can do mine. Hmm. Do you want the cable? Let's see if I can make this work. Um. You have to hit function and F something. Oh. F eight. F eight. Is it doing Okay. Dunno. Give it about twenty seconds, or so. Ah, there we go. It's going. Okay. Okay, so this is just about the technical functions. Alright. So the method, I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are, what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do. And then there are two different kinds that I found. There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be. Mm-hmm. So these are the two different ones. This is the user centred, it has quite a mm fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred, which has a lot more buttons, and probably this is one that people complain about, about having too many buttons that you don't use. Mm-hmm. So basically, what a remote control is is it's to send messages to the television set, switch the channels and the volume and things such as that. And so for this product it's gonna be television only, and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours. And so, for my personal preferences, I think this one is easier to use and has quite a fewer buttons. We want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have. It looks kind of narrow at the top, and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top, then that would be easier. Mm. And so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different. The unique style, maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark, the changeable face-plates, and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about losing it, maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that, so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that. So that's my presentation. Yeah. Okay, I'm actually gonna use the it's gonna cause great technical problems over here. I'm actually gonna use the Yes, rather than the the traditional in fact, I won't even go that far. They probably clip to you. They might be movable. Yeah. They're not connected to anything on the table, you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em. Something like this shape, sort of something that's sort of a more vertical shape, that you sort of hold in your hand, I'm trying to think such as something you hold up like that, possibly with a couple of buttons like that, but with the entire top with the, the infrared or whatever source. Mm. So that it's flying off in all directions, so that again the need to look at the the technicalities of actually achieving that in terms of whether the, power requirements of such a source, compromise our our need for it being mm permanently available. Mm. Whether different technology all these remotes are presumably infrared, like they have been for a long time. We possibly need to be looking at at something different, short range, not like the old radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours. But I think basically if minimum number of buttons is our priority, then we should, as I say, really bite the bullets and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum, possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off. And nothing else. So that it could almost end up like that, but again, except that the risk of losing it. Anyway okay Kate, what are your thoughts on this? Yes, mm. Oh. Which one does this plug into? I think it's all there. That one. I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it That's not cool. That's kind of strange. Anyways. Alright, so I'll just do my presentation on the working design. There we go. Okay just at the whole sort of method of how the remote control works. The basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another system, the TV or the DVD player or whatever. And it does this you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the television, the DVD to tell that what to do. And you need a user interface, which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface that's basically just the sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it. Shoot. Okay. Just general findings. What we need technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source, some sort of user interface, which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that. A circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and a sender and receiver. And oops. Uh-huh. This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for. This just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals to a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once you start pressing buttons. Hmm. Also send signals to the infrared bulb, which will be the part that actually what? Sends signals to the the television. And then you've got your happy little TV watcher there. And so my personal preferences I just think we need sorta big energy source that won't die out, perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in, so it'd constantly be charged, so you wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you. A wide range sender-receiver, so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room, and the channel'll still be changed. Also definitely a user-friendly interface and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a locating device on it, so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions, as they inevitably do, you can find them easily. And that's pretty much it. Okay. It seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before I think your point about the big energy source is a very valid one. Mm. Mm. I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls, particularly sort of independent ones. Given the number of things you buy these days, which have a a lithium whatever battery in. Perhaps we should have the disposable remote control, some sort of typical usage. The the battery will last five, ten years. By which time when all's said and done, the digital television will be taking over in that time scale. Mm. Mm-hmm. Perhaps we should, reduce the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and if anybody manages to run it down, we'll give 'em a new one. Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years? Cool. Fair enough. It's, what it saves in cost and there's a it's actually a marketing gimmick. It's it's totally practical. So I think the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's by, magnetic waves or whatever, if it. A cordless phone in your house it got a base that sits there all the time. Mm, mm. Are are people really gonna use it though? I suppose. I would think that people forget to put their cordless phones back on there, so. Um. Mm. I I think I know that times my wife goes out in the morning and says I should have put the phone on to charge and then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now. Mm-mm. Yeah. Mm. Um. Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies. And that's pretty much. Yeah. When it's died is a problem. When it turns itself off, that's when I plug it in. So what so what do we think about the the permanent mm battery? Think that's a good idea. Uh. That sounds pretty good. No. We we are really going for the ultimate in external simplicity here. Um. Mm. Cut cost within the manufacturing and if we have a high tech interior, then that may well be cost effective. Do they make batteries that last that long? Certainly. I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but there are certainly things that you buy. Calculators for example. They usually have the little light source, dunno what the heck they're called, the but the little cells that. They have that little solar. But there are battery ones that are sort of permanently sealed. Mm-hmm. Mm. In fact this needs going into the technology a bit. They have sort of a combination of the two, when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery, but if there's enough light, then it's using the light, so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time, but you will have the battery there for when you need it. Mm. Mm. The actual time that a remote control is actually operating would is is probably, no more than minutes in its entire life. Mm. If it's depends who's using it, who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking. Um. Some people are. But I say if people are getting RSI from it then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market Right. Then they're clicking a lot. Yeah. This market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used, channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour. Yeah. Per hour? Wow. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. I must admit I'd I'd missed that. That does sound excessive. But then again, if you think of the amount of, use That's it's less than a second. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right, and I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed, or whether it's just a sorta tenth of a second, no matter how long you press it for, don't I don't actually know. Mm. Yeah. Though I think with digital TV, I know on my cable box, you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that, so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of Uh-oh. Um. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right, so I've got a message to say five minutes, dunno how long ago that appeared. cause we're getting right, so I need to sum up very quickly here. We're looking at extreme simplicity. We're looking at a radically different shape. Possibly no buttons at all but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons into the design, then that's fine. In the role of the user interface designer becomes more important here, because, shape is no longer a a serious constraint. But we clearly only need the main buttons, although, if clearly only need the main functions. I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition and the only buttons that I think we need are channel control, volume control and on off. It needs to incorporate the corporate logo, the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers. So does that accurately summarise what we've discussed? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Hmm. Right. I just have one question. So. Are we doing just the television or are we doing so not DVD players, okay, okay. We are doing just the television. No. I think that's quite clear from the information that we've been given, no? Mm. Okay. In the email of television only. In fact they're in the constraints email that I got. Right. Didn't you mention the teletext, just television only? That's one I sent you, which was my interpretation of what came down from head office. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That that that's their view. Okay, so we can all give some thought to that for the next meeting, thank you very much indeed. Okay. Cool.",
