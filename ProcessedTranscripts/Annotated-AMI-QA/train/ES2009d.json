    "displayText": "Okay. I totally 'cause I moved it. S put it over here. Then we don't have to worry about it. Ready for this? All set? Cool. Alright, it is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun. Yeah. Man. So here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and right so I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting. Really? Okay. I think. Huh. I don't know. Otherwise it's just saying therefore I'm taking the minutes, so just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, I will open them slowly, no? Wait for it, wait for it. That's not you. No. That's how the Wait. This is, this is very high-powered stuff here, double-clicking, there we go. So basically the moral of the story from our last meeting was that we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here and what sort of limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under, what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with voice recognition, IE that had a vaguely non-remote shape because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. And the UID and the ID were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at. So. That's sorted, back to the main meet here, go ahead and take it away guys. Well. We have assembled our prototype. What's to be said about it? We took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions. Mm-hmm. This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here, we decided those were the most important buttons. And then, for the more advanced functions there is a slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away. As far as the whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out, why not? Ah. Nice. Fair enough. Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Perfect. Um. No it's important to we talked quite a bit about the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here we call it fruity if you will. Go ahead. Mm. Right. Appropriate, okay. Um. Right, of course that's interchangeable and I think it would be desirable for the regular product in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there. Mm 'kay. It is an option. Right. That's this here. Ah. Um. I see. So that will work quite well with regard to finding this contraption. What other things do we see here, if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel, so I think that will work well with regards to our market. And let's see, clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. Do you have anything else to add to that? I worried about the materials, the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable it's not gonna break some types of plastic that's dropped. And of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel. It's actually important to note that the television, if there's an earthquake or anything like that, that it actually is edible inside. Fact, I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the company's name on the telephone screen, I thought that was kinda nice. Done Edible televisions, it's a wave of the future. Nice. This was actually an apple on the inside. Do we need to worry about rot factors? This. It's encased in a new type of polymer. Okay, there's preservatives involved, we don't need to worry, okay. It's fine. We got a bit ahead of ourselves, I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that, but Right. Hmm. Fair enough. No but It's a couple years off at least. It's a possible new product. Okay. But I think that sums up the main features of the remote, dunno if you guys have any questions or whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature. Brilliant. Did we come in under budget? We did. This cost to put this into production, we're looking at about what was our goal? It was twelve fifty Euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine. So I was quite pleased with that. Mm-hmm. One thing that we didn't do obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons, but we just went for a classic rubber button since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down. Mm. Brilliant. So even though it has a lot of modern technology, for example the voice recognition, in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers we might be able to get even cheaper. Mm. Okay. Mm. Did we talk about the voice recognition option? And no, we haven't talked about that yet have we? So on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console and I think it's nicely designed into the overall look. Okay. Yeah. But basically the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to come up with. Basically quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier I think that has given a proven ease of use and what not. Mm 'kay. Hmm. Yeah. And allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user so. Right. Cool. Any questions? No, no I think thanks guys that's very, very good work. Do we have other, for lack of a better word, skins? Covers? In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have go or? Do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it? Do we know where we stand on that yet? We didn't quite have enough material. I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet. I see, right. As you can see this is just a most superficial layer and it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else It's not quite a face plate, it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory we could very easily put a different one on it, it locks into place such that, it's pretty permanent but at the same time, if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean. Okay. Just veneer really. Right. Okay. Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a new a new a new plate on top of that. Mm-hmm. And the whole thing Okay. Right. So we definitely priced out a even spongier non-natural look materials which I think worked out fine. Yeah. There's Okay. We also continued on with the ideas that following Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the light orange and the green. Mm 'kay. Okay, very cool. Okay. Okay. Yep. It's still an option if we need it. Yeah. Very cool, nice job. I like it, brilliant. What we need to discuss now is the finance of it, you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. The trouble is I was just given this by finance. Oh. It's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like. Ooh. I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly, but it looks like So if we can just itemize what's in here, it's a solar cell thing right? Right we didn't really touch on that but it's in there, yep. With a back-up battery? With the okay. And Clever, well done. The voice recognition area actually doubles as the solar cell area. Yeah. So I guess that would mean It's a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it? It's just making use of the same space and the same materials, but one big curve I guess you could say. Mm-hmm. Okay. And it's more of a single-curved case, guess would be that be the general and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Mm-hmm. Um. Push button interface with this other drop-down maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we? Mm-hmm. Um. And a special guess it's we've got a sort of a wood a rubbery type material that throughout. Special. And I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, don't you? Cause it it is very unconventional, I like to think of it as unconventional. It's quite unique. It's So it looks like a bit over budget. Come in at sixteen? Oh. Doesn't match up does it? So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back-up battery. How do you feel about that? Mm-hmm. I think that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that. Yeah. We could take the battery out of it see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do? Mm. Mm-hmm. People'd be real upset. I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery, it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have. True. Hmm. What's difficult, we have all these things integral to the design of it that we just can't back out of now, seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way. Nah. If we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it, It's either or. Yeah. Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly. Hmm. You might be able to sway me on the idea that our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing that's what sets us apart right? Which, it's that's what setting us into this young market, that's where we started from, so I don't know, and perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league. And the reality is for me from an ideological stand point, I'd like to stick with the solar cell, but I kind of have to throw myself in the business structure model here and I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think unfortunately that's our best option. I guess we might have to do that. It's the only way we're gonna get below our goal isn't it? Mm. Of twelve fifty. Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're and we can't get rid changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm, nor would changing the case materials. Yeah. It kind of. Savings. Mm-mm. Um. So that looks like to be the only thing. Yeah. So it's a major change but. Gotta do what you gotta do. Alright, so we're in agreement on that. Unfortunately I think we are. No, I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah. Right. Moving along swiftly. So I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over. That would be me. Cord? Ah of course, sorry. No problem. Whoosh. Can you reach, that would be great, thank you. Yep. That'd be great Brilliant. I didn't even do that one on purpose either, damn. Okay, basically I was just evaluating from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel they're important. So I was looking at basic design things, does it fulfil its functions as a remote? Is the design what we wanted it to do? Are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for? Um. Basic questions like, does it turn on? Does it respond to voice recognition? And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par. Mm. The only thing is with the pull-out panel, can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface, that looked like it was coming up rough, but then, once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense. So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. Really good. So. They like that spongy feel. Yeah. It looks like it's going over well, so we're good. And the paging function works that's good to hear, we worked hard on that one. Six? We did. Yeah. I think eventually if we do branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into wider range voice recognition from other rooms of the house and stuff, but for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for, so it's all good. I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay. That's everything from me. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. It is a set-back, but Okay, do you need the cord back? We might have lost that granola market again I guess that's true. I was just go on. I know. They don't own tellys anyway do they? True. Right. So, this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair. I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to. So I guess we are going to discuss our project process and that is gonna go into my report. So I guess this is the point where we go out of role it looks and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked, guess. Okay. As in within the team or? I think so. Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or 'Kay. Okay. Mm-hmm, I think so. I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment. It is now, you're in charge so there you go. But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough. Yeah. Whatever. Right, so any thoughts? Are we considering these points here? Um. Yeah. Okay. I think they're starting blocks. What do you guys feel about the process? I think in general, for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive, considering the little amount of input we had going in. Mm-hmm. And the technology has definitely been a help, it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff. We didn't use the whiteboard at all. No. No, no whiteboard. No, we didn't. We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints, doesn't really matter. And also had I not been intrigued about the pen, don't woulda used it at all, I didn't write barely anything. I think I was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen. It's true. Uh. Mm. Was pretty cool tack though. Yeah. Mm. Definitely. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. As you write your personal coach. But I didn't get a response so we'll see. What if you get a response two or three months from now? Okay that would be kinda creepy. That'd be weird. Attempts to contact coach ineffective. What kind of coaching is that really? What if I really needed something. So I think there was a lot of room for creativity, we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us. I think so. And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be. Yeah. With the natural look. That's very natural. Very natural look. Organic, really. That's the brilliance of they had a they had a peeler in here. And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus. Yeah. I think, I thought it was really creative actually. Mm I'm impressed. I think the teamwork was good as well. And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh, we used every bit. Nice. All four of those little containers. I guess My one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with, we only had four, wasn't enough. Including the the multi-coloured wave pattern. Yeah. You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours. I know it could have been amazing. What did you guys think about the the the roles? Hmm. They were good. It was I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough. Yeah. True. At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up, which was kind of fun. Do your own. Though I did feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day. Yeah. Maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all. That's true, I I got this spreadsheet. Nothing, I didn't even get an email, like that was it. So, I feel like that was slightly lacking but then fill in the blanks on your own, level of creativity upped. I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to no but also when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing and then I also felt like a lot of our discussion would centre around specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more, which was fine. Whatever. Of what to do. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, that wasn't very much. Mm. Yes. Mm, mm. Very much so. Yeah. That was fun. I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time. Mm-hmm. Already having the formatted stuff helped a lot. Very much so. Cool. And I think your leadership was quite good. It was really good. Hmm. She said I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I think it's true I felt like I got way too into it. Yeah. That's kind of a good thing though, give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey. I felt like I slipped into it a lot. It's kinda fun. I dunno. So is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role? The first time I've ever done anything like project project management. I usually organise crap, it's one thing to do, set up a party with your friends? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Little different. But you guys felt that you could keep the, suspension of disbelief kind of like the role and the okay? Yeah. Yeah. Except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth, other than that I could only imagine. Yeah. I had to admit, as soon as we started as soon as we got the Play-Doh, the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window. Maybe in Legos? Possibly. Be fun with Legos too, make a remote control or spaceship, we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever. Still have 'em. Yeah. Totally. You guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all? Yeah? I think so. Yep. Hmm. You don't. No I, no I dunno, I I I dunno, I don't I was just It's true? Though we didn't actually other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building, but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative brainstorming, use the board and this would have been six months' worth of work, not three hours' worth of meetings. Yeah. Yeah. I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Course I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team it's kind of. But. Mine was the mics. Interesting. It's kind of fascinating wasn't it? The whole process of don't. Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much what was it that kept us from going to the the board? I I don't know if there was a I Mm. I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires, I was afraid I was gonna break something actually. It 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I dunno what I woulda shown on that board. True, but it didn't even occur to me as an option, I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't. Nor I. It's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for. True. Because I've got this laptop. Yeah. Standard, I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me. Yeah. I wanna see the output files from the digital paper. It looks really professional. I wanna see what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap. I know. That's it. Just to see what it looks like in PDF format or something. Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because New ideas. I know, I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't draw all over my paper and stuff. Okay, not entirely, but still, I doodled less than I usually do. I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like. What exactly we're looking for here. So is this all we need to get through? I dunno, I'm not sure what the new ideas is about. I guess. Um. It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that? Is it Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts? That's the thing I got in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there, mm-hmm. That slide was like that? I didn't change this one at all. Hmm. Well. I guess we're on the right track. I kinda like you can't. No, none. I think they still do their job. I think they're fine actually. I am thinking outside the little square box though, literally in form I don't. Maybe a circle would be alright, different. Does kinda make you wonder, how much can you do with a remote control? It's like inventing a new car. You can. It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road? Don't know. Hmm. Um. What is that? Kay. Our limited ability to think outside the box? Kind of. So this was other costs. Are we back into project mood? I dunno. I think this is forty ish I I mm we should go on a bit about the project eval. How long was our meeting supposed to be? How much time do we have left? I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing. What am I really doing, what is Yep. Mm. At the beginning it started out and I felt actually under pressure the first couple were taking a lot of work and I had all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away. Yeah. Why? Hey. I think it was the real. You know, what I mean we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was not very much. Mm-hmm. Whatever. Mm. Yeah. Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning. Yeah. Very much. I actually didn't do that at all though, every single one I all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em. Mm-hmm. I. I added five slides too, but mine too. See I only got blank ones. Did you really? I just got blank ones and Me too. What? Really? My slides were all blank, they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty. They didn't like mine they didn't come like this? This was what it looks like. With those words already on it? This is what that looked like, literally, just like that. No. No. Interesting. I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated. Uh-huh. I deleted slides. I think I added a slide one time. I added many slides every time. Hey with the whole new background being innovative, that was class. That was pretty cool, it was a high moment of the whole experiment. Mm. Um. Interesting. Any other thoughts come to mind? I wanna know how our product would fare. I can't just leave it there. I think it would fail, I think it'd be a huge disaster, especially if it looks like that. I think it would take extensive marketing, okay, an apple with a red button on top, even I am sceptical. But the whole. Even you. I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face. I know it is. But Builds. It's a happy face. Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to some other design modifications. Mm. Mm. I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from a random Kit-Kat bar that happened to be consumed. I I noticed that. By accident. Interesting. An interesting day all in all I would say. I'd say so. I wanna see a. So again I reiterate my question of how different we are compared to the other groups, especially between culture groups and what not. I know. Mm, I know. Mm. It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically. Yeah. From the the basics to the although the whole concepts phase, I don't think I really understood the concept. Okay the notion of it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material, it is what it is. Cause it's such a functional item. Maybe rather than concepts it should be thought of I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea. And then the final would be the actual specified prototype or whatever, dunno. Mm. But. Hmm. All in all it's kinda interesting. Mm. So we have more slides or? No just this closing one. No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget, but do it We did the project evaluation based on Sarah's evaluation on off switches and Mm. We got it to be. Like cutting corners. Kind of, though it was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general. Mm. Which I'm not sure is the same thing, at the time that just made more sense, but I could see if they were really asking about us. True. Yeah. Cause we we had a think about it. Um. Yeah. And it's all recorded, woo-hoo. I'm gonna put I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff, because and so forth, but I'll put most of it in the reports. Yay. Hmm. It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording. Make it sound eloquent. I've I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing. Nice. There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that, psycholinguistics. What the uhs and the Mm. Really. He's studying ums and ahs or something. Filler words or? Yep, they're called disfluencies. Yeah. Disfluencies. That's a good word for it. We like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things. Just add some prefixes, sounds classier. Exactly I will save this into the project documents. I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot, just out of boredom, come on gimme something. I, pretty compulsively during meetings. Yeah. I know. Come on give me some information. To be fair we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet, so I know, imagine we went the first ten fifteen years of our lives without the internet. We are addicts. That's scary? It is scary. Mm. Just around that eight or nine people that are Dude, I think we've had internet for eighteen years. It's only in the last ten that we're where's the internet? Yeah. Just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time. Yeah. True. No we have but I not in the sense that it's so ubiquitous Mm. Yeah. Yeah. But my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four, but still. It's crazy. Uh-huh. So Should. In the eighties? My grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had an EDU and gov network. There's basically the fundamental structures, but it wasn't household to household yet because it hadn't been partitioned off and stuff, that was him. Right. It was to the seven universities or something. You guys ready to celebrate? That's our last step. Apparently, does that include champagne or something exciting? Celebration. I think so. Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part. I think that's a closer. Cool. Has it been forty minutes or whatever? This has been long enough. Celebrate. Where do you find that? I have no idea. Is that the only song you have? There is another one. Is this one of those media player? Huh? Yep. Oh. That's awesome. The default track. Maybe I have a different one. I thought it was David Burns, look into the eyeball. That's one that seems to be it shipped with for a while, maybe this is the new version. So is that a close? I guess we'll call that a doner. Okay, that's the end of the meeting. Fab. Thank you gentlemen. I feel like I'm signing off.",
