    "displayText": "kay. So Yep. So so so. Put on your mic. So you forgot how this works again? Boss. Boss. Maybe. Maybe maybe maybe. Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product, 'kay? Yep. And here's the agenda for this meeting. I'm just gonna say a few boring words to start with again, and start taking minutes afterwards. You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there. Looks cool. And then we're gonna evaluate it. Then we're gonna talk about finance, and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this. Mm that's I like it. And yep. You knocked it up? And we're gonna evaluate the product and close. Got forty minutes to do this in. We should be fine. Let's try and keep this one on schedule. Alright. So Your thing is in where is it? Third third third. Is it in Who wants it? Three, three. The end product thingy. Yeah. Pedro can have it. I like I'll help talk. So what we ended up with. Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department, which is us, is fifteen point eight Euros, someone forgot the units there unit production price cost thing. Unit price. We implemented the basic functions, which is just TV functions plus the locator, which was one of the marketing things, cradle, scroll wheel for the channels, and we implemented the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping, your favourite channels functionality, in the scroll. Zapping your favourite channels, eh? Yeah. Scrolling through your favourites list. Okay okay. Zapping. Ah 'kay okay, that's favourites. Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing. And that was the result. Ah 'kay. I like the the the the logo on there as well. It's very prominent. It is very prominent. So this is the Okay. So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit, and this is the actual remote itself. So the scroll bar or the scroll wheel is this green little scrolly guy here, and then the volume controls are here and here. You've got the keypad which is the numbers from zero to nine and then ten. This is the power button. We have the enter button and what was the other button here? This is the teletext. Start the start to to programme. The programme button. Ah, okay I see. So this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming the the type of television you wanna use. So the plastic is the white area of the model here, and the red area is a rubber covering. So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber, so it's pretty hard to actually damage it that might be a possible problem, but if you drop it. It's pretty cool. Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it? Not helping. I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it. And it depends on if it's sliding, but I think it's pretty ergonomic. You can feel it. Mm. Feels good. I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well. Of course. This is clay. It's kinda cool. You have to reach a little bit don't you. The power button is a bit of a reach, but I think we might scale down the final model a bit. Ah that wouldn't make sense. This is a bit larger than it would be, but Mm Pedro can demonstrate the paging ability. It's cool. I'm impressed. Don't have no one to handle that. And hold it so what's the marketing perspective? You guys gave me more than I was asking for, so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this. I think it's good. Good good good job. Yeah. So you have the base station with the little button for the where's my remote. Beep beep. It's great. The locator function. Okay. That's great. It's a great feature. Beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep shut up. Mm it's impressing. So let me get it, if I press this button I see. That's pretty cool. Wicked isn't it? Hang on. So you can take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town I can see that. Beep beep okay. I plan to do that as well. No no no that's Exactly that's exactly what those are for. So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in? Ah okay okay. And there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, is you could beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it's it kinda feels like there should be something there, but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there. It's the right shape isn't it? And we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so Mm. But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling, 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides. Right. So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit, but Mm-hmm. Okay. But it's definitely got options for different types of models and things as well based on that, hasn't it? Yep I like. Good job. Is that the final colour scheme as well or? No this is just what we had to work with at the time. No no. Okay. So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people. The. Careful. It came off. The scroll wheels, a problem with them not being sort of I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore. Of course, My my suggestion is we're gonna go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions. Mm. Some blend of silvers and blacks. Beep beep. Okay enough of that. It's cool guys. Kay are we done with this presentation? Yeah. Ja. Okay. Now now. So you're not gonna find my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board. Have you? Okay. So No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I couldn't create it. Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now? I see. I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint, and I think I've got this really strange cable. So what I had, basically going from the PowerPoint format, is that I like this a lot. Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to changing situations in the in the meeting room? Nah. So what we had is we had the method. That's not how you spell method, is it? No way. No A. So this doesn't go so fast this way. And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product. And to me with this product we got basically three things to market. We have the characteristics, and we have I don't know what we would call the other part what we call the the corporate Help me. The corporation stands behind the product, okay. So the features I think we got the scroll, we've got the locator, we've got the durability, we've got the dependability, we've got the features that make this a unique product. It fell off. Beep beep. The characteristics I talk about, we have comfort, we have ergonomics, we have environmentally sensitive. And the corporation, we're talking about we're a new we're a new company. We're wanting to make a name for ourself. We're wanting you to find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price. One thing I would want to see is can we get guarantee on a normal use guarantee, which means that this product, for the life of the life use, if it should have a technical problem, that we could replace it at no cost? That was something I would be interested in. So without going into great details, we have a product, it has the features and the characteristics, and the background, believe, to make it marketable believe at a cost of of thirty thirty five to fifty Euros. We're gonna be competitive, and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche. That would be that would be a decision best made by corporate I for my evaluation, based on what our competition is, I think that we can go after this and and go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense. Do you would you argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty five as we probably could, but lowering our profit margins? Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. But you guys came up with a great product, and at that cost I think there's nobody else that's putting this combination of ingredients together. The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. That's the only drawback I see to this. But with all of these other features one thing I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice. There's gonna be somebody going home and say this thing doesn't work for my DVD they keep it, they don't take it back. And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway, aren't we? There's no fundamentally different technology to do that. One of the thoughts that I had is can this unit be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? A sim card in a in a telephone. Hmm. Is there a card in can we make a card and so Mm-hmm, but you follow what I'm 'cause if we can make this unit upgradable then we're but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything, but that was just an idea I had. We need we need some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but We we could get another version of it that actually works. Mm-hmm. But Very very colourful. To me the only additions. The plus there's the risk of making it unusable as well, or making it less because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons, what they do, it's very simple, and it just works. Yep. Mm there's a risk of that. But anyway that's Mm-hmm. Okay so we can talk about finance now. So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering, you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros, I was wondering how you came up with that figure? That was just our technical team added up the production costs of the individual units. Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this. Oh. Now I've made a few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that we can make for a cost of four Euros, equivalent to solar cells, which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I'm assuming that the locator beacon, the Can be made for it sounded different that time can be made for a similar price to an LC display, do you think that's fair coming from the manufacturing? Yeah. Beep beep. Sorry. I do think that we don't need the events chip on print, we only need the regular chip on print, so there may have been a miscalculation in there. Okay. Yep. Okay. So we're down to sixteen point four. And we have a single-curved that It's single-curved. Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved? We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus? We've got a we've got a curve and a droop. I don't know whether that. Okay I'm convinced. But we save one Euro that way? So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four. See it's a little bit more than single-curved. So that's where we came up with it. Hang on. Don't speak so it's in here, in that do we have any we have special form don't we? Okay. Yeah. We do. So that's. Ah. But the the we haven't talked about any special colour though if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're okay so we're Push-button, scroll wheel, we're basically we have is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll? What do you know. That's not very special, it's pretty If. We don't It's a scroll. That's a scroll. Just a scroll? It's not one of the scrolls where, for example, with this one you could push it down to be a button? No we just use it as a scroll. Ooh. Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros. It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say. It wasn't bad. Yes. We're wicked. Yeah. Awesome. Okay so we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation, where we have a look at the criterion criteria that Paul has given us, and we can use that to tell How's it going? S kind of frighteningly accurate. Yeah. Anyone got any thoughts? What? How how have we done today? I think we did pretty well. Yeah. I think we did pretty well too. That looks pretty spectacular. No, I think we come up with a attractive marketable product and concept. Any other thoughts? Okay so what about room for creativity? That was mm-hmm. Is it the. I think there was plenty of room. I I think we we ended up being quite creative there. We got a couple innovative Couple innovative ideas. We we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every criteria they gave us because we still have the teletext capability in this thing right, we raised the price of it, we've added two new technology to it. Mm. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So if this thing flies then we've adjusted or broken every idea they gave us. Not every idea necessarily, it's still a remote control. Basically. No but we did break with the specs a little bit guess, but the 'Kay leadership, what do we report back to the bosses? But when I say we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause we did it. No I think they were reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing. It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project Teamwork. Yep. I agree. Cohesive. Synergy. Yes synergistic. There was a lot of synergy. Teamwork, he is. Yeah. What did we think of the meeting room, guess is an important thing here. These cables suck. Mm. This falls off and the white board worked really well without any Mm-mm, lapel. Yeah. Yep. And that's you must have very long shirts. Yeah. That's way far down lapel mic. Okay, alright. Lapel lapel lapel. Lapel. That's almost a crotch dear dear. That's it's down, it's quite close. What they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting New ideas for the product or for the the the environment or what are we. Keep it, keep it calm. Dear. No more pizza for me. So the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Cause this is you were using it upside down. Still that Use them like that. That's our boss. Nah, I'm not convinced of that at all. I've been wondering about that all day, but see that looks the that looks like it would be that way around, but it feels more comfortable, what you call upside-down. Pedro's right. Pedro's right. I don't care. Okay so that data might be slightly invalid. What new ideas have we found? We had the favourites list, and the scroll bar, and we have the cradle, and the remote call feature. Let's do both then. For the product? We came up with quite a bit. Bunch of new ideas. And for the meeting room, Has anyone got less sore on the ears. Comfortable headsets would be nice. I mean clearly remote control microphones would be a nice solution to all these cables, but I'm sure that there's some justification for these things that I don't know about. Mm. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon. It's not been cooperating so well, but I don't think that's avoidable. Coulda been worse. Okay so Are the costs within the budget? Mm no. No. Nope. Hang on it really that's something that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros. No requirements are changed. We're still under twenty Euros to build, so we're good. And the costs within the budget? Not the original budget, but they are now. Is the project evaluated? Mm I think so then celebration as it says. Hooray. Okay. Free coke provided at the cafeteria. All right. I don't know how that got there. Anyway. Who wrote that one? Thanks guys. So we need to close this meeting, bravo. Congratulations. Cool. Good job guys. I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay. I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too. Oh.",
