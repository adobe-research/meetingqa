    "displayText": "Ah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yep. Did I tell you that we've got kind of two-way interaction? If you control click an utterance, it will play where it should be in the file. Yeah. No, I'm just sort of like preparing people for it looks like really nothing. It looks like basically less than their stuff, but actually Dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and if we hooked it up with my display, then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can select individual segments and click on them, then play that part in a compressed way and display density information. Now at the moment the application is Yes, sure so at the moment we have a dialogue act window and a graphical display I'm not sure. We should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do. Are you missing the sound? No, the interesting thing is the sound came when I tried it last time after I triggered off something by clicking on something. There it is. There suddenly they come. Probably they're just slow at loading. And they don't have the buttons yet. Yeah. So at the moment the display is still dis-coupled from it. That's Vera's data on the display. But the segments are just made up, aren't they. The segments are made up at the moment, but the code's there for integrating real segments. And this is summarised based on just Vera's data at the moment, from some part of the meeting. So we're we're not loading the whole thing at the moment yet properly. But the important thing is this is summarised based on I I realise I'm always pointing at my screen and you don't see. So this stuff is summarised based on on these intensity measures. And we don't have the exact audio record for this. Usually say we should have just copied it. So just to show, Dave has put a music file in there, and the music file is playing without gaps. That's because the way how we handle it at the moment is that Dave prepares an audio file, creates an audio file dynamically from just the chunks that we wanna have, and that runs in synch with what we have in the I'm not even sure why I'm making loud. Mm-hmm. It's just So we see that running along with playing of the music we see the the highlight of the dialogue acts. Right. That's pretty good. You can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well. Okay, and and that already this part here already is dynamically created. Shall I just load it with Jasmine's data, just to see a different Where's the Quite old. If you want. That one looks almost just you need to The very first one. Which version of my data was that, the very first one? Yeah. Doing this, we were just concerned with the whole stuff. Okay. Yeah. Really doesn't matter. And Dave, where what am I looking for? Just wanted to know if I'm just. Am I looking for in data manager? Where am I looking? It will be in program. Or is it is it where the is it where the file names are? Is it here? Where do I call your display? Is it here where words importance file? No, it is on your display. Where it calls which one to get, you just need to change the flag. In my display. I think it must be, unless it. Let me I Just Okay, so where did you say, in where that is, just about? How how do you do the summary? Are you basing it on certain thresholds over a special okay. No, actually you can change it in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager, you can do it. No, not yet. It's just picks the top-ranked ones at the moment. The easiest thing is in programme manager, where it makes the summary. It's probably the best place to do it. It'll be above that. Above that. It'll be down. In this main in this routine? It's gonna be after the data manager's made. That. A new summary. There is something read importance with a zero and there is read word importance with a one. Can't remember where I put it. Shall I swap those around? Hmm? Maybe it will be in the summary constructor then. Try the summaries constructor. What's the so this is. It reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one which one it gives back. Shall I just swap the file numbers around from now? If you want. Or would that crash anything? That should be fine. And we really leave a. Maybe have to find out where. I should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag. Mm. Mm. So you have time this afternoon? Yeah. Yeah. So here. So this shows if we see anything at all, then we see at the moment at least that we are definitely having a different summary, just because we're having a different important measure. So you see that it does something. At the moment I think that's an old old version. That's the old one. Yeah. Okay. And so if you think about how the old version happened, then see it makes sense that words like prosody, just like a if that was the only utterance, then that probably scored quite well and stuff. Okay. Mm. We have to get these buttons, Dave. Yeah. Probably. It's weird. On mine it complains about Okay. Probably all these uh-huhs and uh-hmms are spelled differently in the thing or what's the problem. Yeah. You should generalise. Unfortunately, I didn't get the the bar on the display working just yet. But that should be a small issue. Ah-ha. That's a very old one rather. I think those Ss and Es and so on, the single letters, are because of the problem with my first version of the text thing. I know this is very old. We just never bothered to update the stuff, because we were working on so we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one. Cause I think the. So from here we go, and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now first of all put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are. So I'm I'm constantly touching stuff on my screen I realise. And and then make selections based on a segment. Now what we're not quite sure is what's the best way for how the summariser works. Should it always compress a segment to a constant length though, by a constant factor of time? Or What would you think sort of if, if there's a certain degree of summarisation, what should be the constant? Mm, I suppose it should depend on the length of the segment. So always like a. So it should always, whatever, reduce it to half the original 'Cause an alternative view would be that. Mm, I guess that would make more sense. But perhaps more than half. Otherwise you go in too slowly. I guess that could be adaptable. Cause an an alternative view would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length. So if you like if the whole meeting is selected, it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes. Hmm. Then if segment, one topic is selected, then it plays this whole topic in five minutes. But that gives people a bit less control over so maybe we should do it instead that it it you can. I think that to be honest is something we can worry about at the end. That's quite trivial to change and we got a lot of other work to do. Hmm. What's that you discussed for today though? What's there to talk about for today? I was wanting to talk about the search. We need to get on that pretty shortly, I think. Yeah. I'm quite keen to do most of that. Make an index search and stuff. Okay, so I'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle changing results. I think basically what I need at is just a list of words with an index to start with for each meeting. What kind of index? I suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and I can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display. Take and make them in a hash map or something. Probably. Shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole one whole group as one single thing and just work on a certainly from now on probably for good that means. Certainly for now. No. Yeah. Yeah. You know how you've just got data for one meeting, are you needing more at the moment? From the point of us developing it, it doesn't really make much difference. Mm, I guess not. Do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment? So you want to send Steve the prototype and we should change data. Are you are you all working on the same meeting? I think we're all using the first one. Hmm. Okay. Did anyone ever check if that's actually a good meeting or comparably to others? I think it segments quite well though, first one. Kay. Where's the best best place to put it? Sorry, the only problem with the first meeting is for that there's a hot spot annotation for that. Oh. But that's not a real problem. I think it might. Do you take it from my directory? Or do I have to put in the but would you take it from my directory? At the moment it's just an old file. It'd probably be, best to make a copy of it. Or okay. I'd have thought. I don't think I'm gonna be able to do the speech tools through Java native interface 'cause the documentation for them is horrific. It's really bad. So I think I'm thinking I'll just write out a script and do it with a system call. Yeah. Kay. Yeah. Not yet. I just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it. No. Yes, it's not really important that we get it nice and clean or anything like that. Yeah. Especially because that's that's only done once every time the selection changes, right? Hmm. So even if you do an hourglass at that moment and, even if it pauses for ten seconds, that's tough luck then. I don't think it would take that long anyway. Think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of. So we just start everything after the summary's been created. So. It's not a big problem. There's a wait for command for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general that's sort of running parallel, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I have some code for system calls like that handles the in and the output if you need some of that. I don't think I'll need that really 'cause I'll just dump out a temporary file. Okay. Okay, cool. I don't really know what to talk about. See there's one week after my dissertation. So we're before the presentation of the prototype. Which I can work a lot lot lot on this. So that's good. The graphic display will definitely have more information. I think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end. Cause are we gonna have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff? Mm. Because if if we're not then we'd probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information. If we're at the moment abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings just because it's for us more bureaucracy, more complexity, and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation. Mm. Or do you like We're As one meeting. Because Steve lay quite a lot of weight on surfing through meetings. So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group. At the beginning he talked quite a lot about that. It's not too difficult to do and it's sort of a hack kind of way 'cause we can just treat it all as one meeting. And then maybe have some basic information. If. But we'll just create hard segments at the start and end of each meeting. Ones that are red instead of black or something like that. So just a little bit of additional information in the display that knows where meetings, picking it over, and otherwise internally we treat it like so we have continuous IDs for the segments. Mm-hmm. That works. So other than, we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing. Yes, but apart from that we don't really do anything different as if it was just one meeting. Yeah. That's quite a cheap way to do it. I completely agree. So the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries. And what about the similarity measure for segments? Do we also present that in this window, and do we do it across meetings? So initially I thought it was sort of more a search functionality that simply there's one button that says find similar segments, and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search. I think that was planned at the beginning, wasn't it? Yeah. Okay. I'm not so displaying an information about similarity to a selected meeting to a selected segment in the other segments? So it wouldn't be displayed in the graphical display. Oh. No. I'm just coming back to our initial idea of presenting all the similar segments across meetings and separating by some things like Mm-hmm. No no, I think I really don't wanna do that to be honest. It would be nice but just but it should appear as a continuous thing for the. It might be possible to do it in the summariser. It will still appear continuous on the display. But I'm not I'm not sure if it's worth much bother though. If we do a similarity search, and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment, I think that's quite useful even without displaying them sort of dis-continuously. How are we gonna display the search for this corpus? I was thinking of just really just a more or less just imagine those are search results each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever. We should aim to get some names for segments, like just some extraction of something that we can call. And if it's just the single highest importance measure phrase of a segment, so that we have something to display for them. Basically just a summarisation down to one segment. And it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then you then the whole bureaucracy kicks in this gets the notification. I think so. Yeah. Okay. And then we could sort of use the same thing for yours and mine. Because yours would sort of give just the segment IDs and mine would give the start segment IDs. Yeah. Right. So basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts. Maybe also something where something ends, for mine, and some string that we pass to describe what it is. Yeah. You wait, your search, what would it return? It would go right to the utterance, right? I suppose it returned the utterance, but if you're searching for a word, you need an index for the word and the utterance as well. Sure, sure sure. So in your case it basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the. It'd probably select it. It would make sense to do that. And in my case it would say some name for the segment, and then you would just click on it and then the whole thing would kick in. Yeah. You click on it and the selection moves and the display goes to that part. Okay. How advanced are we gonna have our search? Because I think we should be able to restrict it to specific speakers and things like that, but nothing too fancy. Very very basic. Yeah. If if you can pass me the dialogue act with was it the speaker. Do we have them with a speaker at the moment? And then that that should be enough, shouldn't it? With a speaker ID. Okay, cool. In fact if someone could create a file with the speaker IDs and speaker names. Cause I did that. Just random So what about So what about a general layout like this that we have here, the dialogue acts and there the player And here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button. I have that file. That done? Okay. I did that as well actually. So just Did you overtake that code from the original thing? Where is it? Is it in the group directory? Yes, in the data. Speaker data, or something. Okay. The data manager should be quite well documented. Yeah. So you should be able to use that for the search quite easily. Right. Yeah. Is it sorry, could I use that? At the moment it's ready to get dialogue acts out with. On the dialogue act level. I've not got it reading in the topic segments yet. Just 'cause that was lower priority. But you can get all the utterances. Alright. I should maybe just get started with 'em. Making a search with that. Hmm. So where are gonna put the search results? We can Ah, good question. If we move everything to the right a little bit and make a little bar on the left. The search results in there. Yeah. Yeah. I think we probably we can leave those I frames and just arrange them sort of. Yeah. We'll. We'll get something to print out their locations. So we'll arrange it in a nice little order. We. Alternatively we'll have the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually. My apparently Microsoft sometimes or at least in the past the demonstrations where they just exactly knew which five percent of the system were working. It's quite easy to do though. So I think we probably should. And that's what we're gonna do as well. Yeah. Has anyone ever seen anything from the other group? No. We should try running that thing again, see what it does now. They have all Ah. Yeah. They have all sorts of scarily good If anything we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation. Or just delete or back-up it. Of course, we've got here. That would be evil. So I can print obscene messages in the background to standard output. Yeah. Dear. Oh. Yes, because we are nice people. Dave, this rate thing, do we have any direct control to that? Or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of we can only That's a pity because it looks like it's doing something. It doesn't seem to work very well. It's capable of slowing down the audio, but speeding up doesn't seem to work at all. You have to pause it and play it for the. That's their clock component. Kay. But also speeding up the audios and where we have a moving band the graphical display that also moves according to the. It's all the same component that does that. Do you think if we override their component and just override whatever, the action to that slide-bar is? No, we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does. This thing is really bizarre. It slows it down a bit. The speed up doesn't seem to work. Maybe it has a different constructor when you create it. Yeah. Also their grasp of algebra is terrible. Is it? Two times, it should be half. I suppose. Cause that'd be playing it backwards twice as quickly. Yeah. So if something like their skipping, would it actually corporate with our system at the moment? Would ours skip automatically forward? It should do, but you've probably gone past the end of the file. I realise. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe they have got the minus in the code as well, and then something in is messed up. I don't know. Uh. I think it did do it. It's that bright selection. Uh-huh. Whatever. Do you think a tree-view for an overview of the whole set of meetings would be good? Either that or Something that might be quite cool is if you could some applications, when you open a file, you get a little preview. I think this simple view that we get that you can just pass things into and then check when they got clicked really. It would look good. If we could do something like that that displays a five line summary when you're about to open the file or something like that. Hmm. I suppose you could calculate them off-line and just, have a little thumbnail or something. Hmm. Yeah. Couldn't the no, then we would have to override though. The summariser is quite quick. It could probably do it dynamically. Yeah. It would be a bit pointless, but it would look good for the presentation. It'd look pretty and I'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines. Yeah. I suppose. Yeah. Hmm. But in a sense if we see but probably that would be the same thing that we also display up here. But Another quite good thing might be you know how easy it is to apply two tips to things in Java? Because I really think that having some that would probably even be shorter than five lines. Really just getting I think getting one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile. For the search results I probably think that instead of a simple summary, something that displays the utterance where the word was displays in a highlighted form where it was found. Hmm. To to apply what? I've never done it before. I've never done it, but I'd imagine it must be quite easy. Cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result, you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context. The utterance before, the utterance itself and the utterance after. It'd be nice for a presentation. So that when you hovered over it if we can get the tool tip, we should use it though. Alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component, whatever, like if this was the search results, and then they are just like something else that's part unwritten when Miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something. And a very especially with a preview we'll be able to get tool tip fairly simple because it's just a property of it. Cause I think it should be quite easy. Hmm. That's what I would have thought. I've never seen tool tips displaying several lines and stuff though so I wonder how good that'll look. But we'll we can try that. It's quite common in some applications. Really? Yeah. So far only seen tool tips of few words length. But that should be fairly easy. We will have. That's actually just gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well. Hmm. Is that quite easy to do to get a moving cursor? The thing I remember, I have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time, because see, it takes a fraction of a segment to display, but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second. So at the moment whenever it needs to be repainted, I'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing with a moving bar that's not a good idea. But until I think of something better, what I'll just do is I'll just I'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length, but just some indicator somewhere. Whatever, just a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something. Hmm. And then I can just repaint a small area or something. All you need to do is just one value. And the area could be smaller. The height, it doesn't change in value, does it? So if you just remember the colour that it was last at and you re-draw a line behind it of that colour and then the next one. Yeah. I have to find out the commands for really just redrawing a small small piece. So there's examples for doing stuff like that. I just have to read up on it. But displaying the current position bar will be easy, provided that my whole calculations of where we are in time here are all correct. That's just something that isn't tested so far. Yeah. But it should be. So the general concept, will you two just keep on working on improving the information density measures or do you think there'll be a point when you say that's it, we have an information density score and we'll be looking for something else to do? Or Okay. I'm pretty sure that I can always find something to improve there. So if you need me to work on something else, I can try to finish my stuff early, but otherwise I can still keep working on it, improving it, I think. Kay. Actually at the moment I don't see how many people can work on the programming anyway. No, right now it probably won't be that much benefit. Hmm? Right now it probably won't be much benefit. No. As soon as I've finished all the meetings I think there's not that much to do unless I get some evaluation method. But that could be quite difficult. I would have to tag some part of it or something. Did we Mm-hmm. Because if I if I can't evaluate, I can't do any better. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Because I don't know how to do better if I don't evaluate anything. Mm-hmm. So this is the component based evaluation he was talking about yesterday, isn't it? Yeah. He's really keen on that, isn't he. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was sort of just like a decision we had taken. So that's a bit annoying, 'cause it's my hope we could just go cobble something together and just say look it's great. I was just gonna do some sort of informal evaluation. Mm. Yeah. So okay, we've been talking about evaluation in the first report and there's nothing new we can say about it this time. I did say that. And I thought we said that in the meeting before we wrote the report. Yeah. Yeah. And then he came back with this whole criticism saying you didn't say anything about evaluation and then but we did that in the last report. We said we're not gonna go but now I expected it in more detail and. He did give us eight out of ten though. If that translates to eighty percent, if those actually translate to really their percentage scores, then that would be good. Yeah. I think they do 'cause that's the first sixty percent or isn't it? Hmm. Sixteen? Cause it's I thought they were thirty percent each. Yeah. Yeah. What? No I think they were ten percent each. I don't know. Ten percent each. Only ten percent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There were forty percent each and this is how they became sixty percent Now what Okay. I thought they're thirty. How much do you think there were? I think they're worth ten percent? Yeah. Ten percent. Ten each. Yeah. Not bad. It it just means that he's relatively lenient because I think they were good reports. But probably somebody else wouldn't have said they were excellent. So that's a good sign 'cause it shows that he's not hell-bent on And then he'll see the final display and he'll realise that it was all fake, that we didn't actually do any of the work. Hmm. I suppose he can see that we're putting the work in. Yeah. No, but it's. Cause I think we'd rampantly underestimated how long it'd take to do the actual software engineering bit. That interface and integration. See the thing is for me personally, I think a lot of work will be done in the last minute, in this specific case. That's not a new statement at general. But the week just before the presentation, I have most of the stuff that I'm doing now, I'm rid of it, including the dissertation and DIL. Mm. Mm-hmm. Same for me. See I'll probably just be starting stuff then 'cause I'll be starting the SNLP thing and the DM project. So. No, I forgot about that. What are you doing for your DM project? I'm gonna do an on-line museum archive. You get a document for each exhibit. Oh. I kind of nicked the idea. He went about code ML. I'm gonna make one for guitar tablature. That'd be quite a good one actually. Yeah. But I I think it might have been bit off more than I could chew. So I think it's gonna be quite hard. Would you have to do music notation and stuff? Mm tab doesn't usually have music notations, just pitch information. Right. Okay, that's not so. See how far I get anyway. So Jasmine, if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data, would that help in I sort of have been promising this for a week now I realise. I'm gonna give you 'cause it's empty at the moment. Don't know if it might be of help. Yeah. Dave pretty much it should be a question of copying it over it over, right? Mm. So I just didn't. You can easy add a command line parameter. It's not essential though, I think. Can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because I think it's a ready-made component that returns a string for a file name. Mm. It may even return a file directly. Or that. Possible. So we can do that today? Probably. Yeah. The thing is, I don't know. It doesn't really make sense to call it file open or anything like that 'cause that's it's more like an option. To set the par. But why don't we? Because it reads everything just from one file. I know, sure it would not necessary need to be a part of the final thing, but why don't we just provide some means, even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a start-up option, just to ask for a file name. Mm-hmm. Cause then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts. Hmm. What happened to me today, I'm not sure if we had that problem before, finding the Java X media stuff on all the jars for that. That did happen once before. I was suddenly panicking at eleven when I realised God, I just thought it would be very straight-forward to get it going here. And then I got that thing. Yes, so if we do a version which automatically opens up a file open box. So you're automatically producing the right format with just per utterance. Hmm? I print the utterances in the ID. Okay. No, the ID of the utterance and the measure I think. Mm-hmm. So would it be difficult slash impossible at the moment if we treating a whole series as one thing. So creating one file for the whole series that gives the ideas from top to bottom But the entire corpus. Or even just the entire corpus. That's what Colin's file has got. That shouldn't make too much difference. It. If I just take a file or where one meeting is in or concatenate all those, shouldn't be too bad. Does his? It's it's easy to load that much just text. Yeah. Where do you think you can produce something like that. I think we should go for one group, not for the whole corpus. I think it makes more sense to go for the whole corpus because the the IDs gonna have gaps and stuff in them otherwise. And it means you have to read through the list of utterances when you're compiling all the data over and over and over and over again. So you want the dialogue act numbers to be continuous throughout the corpus so that second meetings begins with three hundred something. No no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No but Dave so that's what I was thinking that the second meeting should continue till the first one's stopped. And for one group that's true because it's sort of like their meeting's like that one meeting and then? At the moment the main data that's just uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus. At the moment from the dump file, it's just got them uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus. Hmm. The utterances. Hmm. Okay and that's the But it just doesn't make sense in the logic-wise, sort of until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's this like. And it makes more sense to do that anyway because that means you got more flexibility with how you want to group them. And one thing you really don't want is ever to have two utterances that could potentially have the same ID. Whereas maybe we're talking so your data manager, would that then handle the whole thing? But that's the point of the data manager is to manage all that. Couldn't we just take a name each dialogue act meeting dot dialogue act number. It's possible, but it's it's not really much point. It would be a longer name, but A problem. Cause at the moment it's got quite nice property that the dialogue act number also coincides with the array index number in the array of dialogue acts, which is quite nice. Would that handle it that the display would only display one group? You could choose whatever you wanted. So if I don't mind where it's done. So if the data manager filters it out and I just think that in the logic of the programme it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings as one single thing rather than But would just I would find logical reasons for why you can say but like I see each group is completely separate amount of data that shouldn't Okay. But you may not be interested in the same series each time. You might want to display all meetings that had a particular phrase mention, say. And those might not be the ones that we enumerated as one meeting, in which case you're gonna have conflicting IDs and things like that. Whereas the if you do it in the data manager, you can control any logic like that programmatically rather than doing it by hand and setting it in stone for all time. It's just good practice. It separates the data from the programme logic. What you're talking about doing is embedding some of the programme logic in the data. But that's a decision we're forcing on the user when we don't have to. But would we still in the logic of it still have continuous IDs if we say we take just one meeting. Would the display for example still be able to just say I want from whatever from the first until the last and everything in between sort of and the data manager would then display that just for that meeting. I don't see why not. Okay if that's possible. Have you currently got continuous IDs for your topic segments? I've only done the first meeting. But that's the plan. Okay, I thought you had done all of them and. For the topic segments? Sorry, for topic segments I have. Yeah. But for the utterances I've just got one meeting so far. Mm-hmm. But the idea was that it would be continuous. Yeah. Okay. I think everything should be that, continuous in chronological order. Okay. Is that what you've got, because the different meeting series overlap. I think. Yeah. Remember how did I do it. Hmm. I don't know. For example as there are not F zero values for every speaker or sometimes not for every meeting, how will I count that up? I'm not sure, I haven't really looked at the data. Ah okay. If there's no value, I guess you have to put a zero in. At the moment I don't even generate any document for those. Yeah. Because it's just a noun. Hmm. It might be more sensible to assign it an average value. But wouldn't it be better for the importance measure if that just wouldn't be part of it then? The? We'd only use F zero when it was present though, wouldn't we? We'd want to use F zero when it's present. That's what Vera said. No. So you you'd you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no F zero. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how we're gonna do the fusing of the different importance measures anyway. Yeah. If that's done in the programme or if that's done off-line. I think it should be done in the program 'cause we're probably gonna want to change it. In the summariser it'd be the ideal place to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Does anyone have a good idea at the moment to play around with it, what's a good way of displaying two types of information in the colour display. There's probably logical ways, like if one is whatever, if one is the darkness and the other is the redness or something. Has anyone ever experimented with sort of displaying two-dimensional information in in colour? Because then we could do Jasmine's and and Vera's probably in the same scale. You could use red green and blue to display up to three. Yeah. But do we really do display them separately because the user won't okay, for now for our okay. For now. No, for now. For us. Might be interesting to the user though, just the word importance maybe. But then the user would have to know about what was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones. Hmm. Yeah. I think we shouldn't We should assume a non-linguistic user. I think that wouldn't be a good idea. But I think probably for us, in developing it, it would be interesting. Mm-hmm. So I'll try the red green blue. What's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing, like what that no, nobody's done much colour work. I don't know how to do it in Java. But The trouble is that hue isn't a very sensible scale. Actually it's not a problem of doing it. I think it's Okay. It comes up to red two or three times and stuff like that. Okay, I guess I'll just take a look at the Photoshop colour cube or whatever it is, GIMP colour cube, and look at. Or you could just split it into two blocks, suppose, for now. Yeah. Kay, so we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialogue box where you can select a file? Is that right, Dave? Would we be able to do that? Yeah. And and then you'll get this type of display with that file. And at the moment are we still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now? Are talk about swapping now? There's no reason why it can't swap meetings at the moment if the data's there for it. Switching. Yeah. So everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now? Or Okay. That's most sensible way to do it, I think. Okay. We need the explicit information about each meeting then. Sorta from which utterance it goes and stuff. It's not reading that in yet, but that will be part of the data manager as well. Is anyone is anyone providing that at the moment? There's access classes all defined for that. I does any Okay. It's in your file, isn't it? Mm. Yeah. Cause each utterance has got an ID associated with it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Couldn't we write one programme that calculates for all our different contributions to the importance measure the absolute dialogue act numbers for the meeting. Because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately. I don't know. I'm not sure about that. So just enumerate up for the next number. Three. But we should all use the same programme, I think. Hmm. Would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it. Or at least the mistakes would be consistent. We should be consistent. As in I just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do to do different things. No, it's not really difficult. It's just I can do it. I can read in the different importance measures and then re-calculate the numbers. As long as. As long as everything's in the right order, it shouldn't like we should even be able to just ID it when we're reading it in. But we have got the index for converting from Vera's IDs to yours. So it shouldn't be a problem, should it. Hmm. It should be easy to do. I've done that for the correlation as well. Hmm. So that's what that was quite easy to do. Kay. No, it's just for one meeting at the moment. I've got the indexes for all the meetings I think. Okay, sure. Yeah. So if we email out a script on how to load it so yours would always be loaded in, I guess. There would only be one version of your data, and you can just override that version if you want. But you wouldn't have a file open dialogue box for that then. No, I don't think so. That's what I meant is it's a bit pointless having it as file open 'cause it will be opening those files all the time. It's more sensible to have it as an option and the location of them. What would the option be? Or just so you can configure the the location of all the files as an option. But when it starts up it should just read them from the default place. Okay, so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarisation or 'cause it 'cause I was just thinking sort of so that both Jasmine and Vera could see their data working and Mm is that not getting too much? That makes sense. Of course there's no reason why we can't make a development version that has two utterance windows and two graphical displays. Obviously it'd have to pick which one to synch the clock to. To add another dialogue act window is really easy. So we would have each of those components for Jasmine and Vera. Say if you could make a change to your thing so it could display it in two halves. I know. So the bottom half the other. Yeah. Yeah. Or maybe three actually. Maybe top half one, bottom half the other and the third one an average that we can change the parameters for. Mm-hmm. And then I could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts. But would that not require three clocks but that but but that also means Okay. No, I'd just have two of them not synched up because it's just for evaluating the data. Cause the display also gets the information about the relative and the absolute times. So that would be convenient if that just if there's just one of that, 'cause otherwise it's getting messy. Right, I see what you mean. So why don't we make a switch instead, I don't wanna do three internal time-scales so that's just getting messy. No, no, it's still good, because no, it isn't. I know what you mean. Yeah. I guess really alternatively why don't we go for the simplest thing and just create three scripts or two scripts common line parameter, which file to load, and then it's just there. I suppose. No, hold on, you it wouldn't need three internal time scales, 'cause only one's synched to the clock and the others are all absolute real time, aren't they. Okay. That's what's displayed on that, the bar, is real time, isn't it. Yep. So they would all be in the same time scale. Okay. Would the others you you just have three summarisers, and then they're all synched up with one clock. No no, only one of them synchs, and two of them are just. Okay, the other one is just a static dialogue acts box. Cause it doesn't really matter. They synch up for the purpose of evaluating the data. Okay. Okay. Yep. So we have three colour displays. Three or No no, sure. Yeah. Not in the final version, just for now. Or maybe just start with just two without even combining them in any sophisticated way. Just just two. Yeah. Yep. Kay, shall we wrap that up? Sorry, I'm imposing. How easy would it be to make it so you can add arbitrary numbers of them do you think? You mean discontinuous? No, different measures to the display. If I have to do it flexibly, then I probably then it will not be significantly more difficult. But is it worth any effort though? That's the thing, if it's gonna take more than an hour or something, it's not worth it. Cause we'll never have more than two and we'll never we'll either have one or two. Yeah. So in the end 'cause you don't have different versions of I guess you probably would have. Mm. But then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it, specifying the parameters. Mm. But that we wouldn't so we'd have to have some dialogue box for opening stuff. But that's easy 'cause mine can take any number of parameters. It might be it might take half an hour in the display and not more than that. Mine, I'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the summariser. Hmm. But it's more or less ready to go with that. But it might I think it might not really be worth it to be honest. Let's work on the other stuff first, like the other stuff, and just provide something where each of them there's a Jasmine script and a Vera script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in the thing. They they each can see it summarised by their data, and the other one is the static one. Okay. That should be fairly easy to do, right? Yep. If I just double the display and you make a non-synched up second dialogue acts. Mm-hmm. Should be easy. And then they can fine-tune their measures. I think it would be cool if we could check the NITE clock code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those rate things and and do something useful with them and get notified when they change and stuff. We could just make that rate be something completely different, just disconnect it from whatever it's doing, and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that. I think I think that's what we should do. So the the thing is it's probably an easy task to read that rate, but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed. So that's why we might have to extend NITE clock and override the function that react to that. Or the rate is probably a property, which in the worst case we'd have to set public, but if we wanna react to it being changed automatically, we might have to. Mm. It doesn't react to it being changed automatically. It only reacts when you press play at the moment. Okay. So they haven't okay. So you have to stop it and start it to make any effect. So even if to even if if we have to extend NITE clock, it should just be a matter of changing one single method in it. Mm. Just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarisers. Yeah. Yeah. That makes different length summaries. Yeah. Cause we could make that not even have a real sort of meaning, just put max and min. Hmm. And the user can just set it in-between wherever they want without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what I mean. Yep. Yeah. Yep. And we could justify all sorts of stuff like that by in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people. Yeah. I think that's sort of a line we should go by in general, sort of saying we could've done so many We don't wanna confuse people. We should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well. Cause that's incredibly unintuitive. We give people something simple and colourful where something is moving and where they don't have to deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter. In fact that's why we've given you a picture of a dog sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser. It is nice and it calms people down. What kind of change will you impose on the summarisation? Because if we fine-tune according to that and it's not finished, it's doesn't make any sense. But it won't make any huge changes, like it'll always have the ability to read the original ones. Okay. Right. But it might be quite cool to have a combined measure. Uh-huh. Just a weighted average is probably the most sensible way to about it and possibly thresholding it. Hmm. Okay. So you at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's above it is displayed. Or so it's some kind of threshold that is set, okay. No, it just takes the top twenty or fifty or however many. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shall we meet in an hour or so, Dave? I'm probably gonna eat something quick. I was gonna go to the gym at about three. Or to be honest, it's much quicker for me to get stuff done on my own. Ah okay, actually I was planning the same, but we won't get so much done before three, that's the thing. It'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately. Kay listen, so why don't we meet after three then, because then I can until three make sure that I have all the display sure. It'll be after four then. Cause I'm gonna go at three. The gym. So we could meet at five and I have the display code ready by then, which does the stuff like having a bar where the position is and stuff. Okay. And. So say five till seven, that should be enough time. Because it's much quicker if we're both working separately, I think. Cause when we've been working together I've just not got a lot done. That's true. And when I go home I'll spend the same amount of time and get loads done if you see what I mean. Yeah. So we can meet in five at five in Appleton tower and just work on so I'll have my I'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about until then. Okay. And then we'll put those things together. Okay. I'll be working on the search, I think. It's ready to get started. So you're gonna be up there as well then? I may as well come and you can show me how the manager works. Yeah. Yeah. But we should discuss together which how the search interacts with the rest. So that's not something that Colin should just do in his own.",
