    "displayText": "Help. It's up there? That screen's black. Alright, okay. Okay, that's fine. God. Are we done? Right, okay this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place. Right our agenda for today, do you want us to give you a second? No that's okay, sorry. Okay, I'll go over what we decided last meeting, we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, video equipment. Mm-hmm. Sorry. It was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone. We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, that kind of thing. Our budget would have to try not to reflect our budget, that we might have a bit of you can see it, okay. Dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like. Want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer. We discussed a flip-open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like things like that. Okay. Three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first? Is it okay if I postpone that til later, I just want to get access to a little bit more information, is that okay? No that's fine. Okay, I'll go first. Can I grab the Thanks. Unplug me. What do I have to press? F eight? FN function F eight. Right. Okay. Maybe Yep there we go. Yep. Okay this is the working design, presented by me, the Industrial Designer extraordinaire. Kay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? A device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel or the volume, everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. So I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one. And I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless and, you don't need to send very much information. Most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky so I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control. Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there, is that appropriate? Mm-hmm. Sure. You're saying the triple A batteries are small or the surrounding it? No no, if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in. Mm-hmm. Right, the triple As are the smallest you can get are they not, right? The you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across. They are. Okay. I see. Okay. Which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, as I said about which batteries we were gonna choose, we can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information. Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the TV unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I just had a quick look at the external design but I left that mostly to the interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do. I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the UI interface which would basically, when you pressed anything the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using since that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all TVs use at the moment. And then finally, we want it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are low in cost so that that should be good. It should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about, because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have, that was just sort of a general point there. Mm. Mm. Mm. And that's. That's a very important part, it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that, whenever you like me to present. Alright okay, and that's what I came up with there, so if you wanna Ooh. Okay, thank you very much. Would you like to continue on from that? Yep. Kay. Or, maybe move the laptop over. It can be okay, that's okay with me. Further. Oops. Why's it not working? F eight, right? F function. Function F eight. Okay. Mm why's it in the right? No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom, has it? It's connecting. No. No, no it's just. Meter adjusting. There. Okay. Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention, but basically my method was whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll take a feedback from the marketing because I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. Yeah. So purpose, as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I would say it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say the young generation or trendy generation want to say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah. With that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also, so we can add in more features and make it less costly. This is if you ask me personally, I would make flip-top with a trendy design and maybe we should look at also the buttons whether they are soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that. Yeah. So in overall a simple and user-friendly design. Mm. Any comments like, if you want? Kay. I think we'll chat about it at the end, okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end, Ooh, it's vibrating, that's strange. Okay. Kay. Sure. God. Right, okay. Have I got to keep this here? I think you'll have to You can't It'll have to this can't be pulled. Does it matter? I'll have I'll have to move it won't I? We just do the best we can. Whoops. You'll have to push it a bit more. Will it manage? Bit more, dear. Yep. This is more than enough. There we go, I've got a bit more of the cable. Okay. Oh. There we go. Is that okay? I think you can pull it out now. Thank you, just pull it closer a little bit. You should be able to and there you go. You might. Get it right over, okay, thank you. Ah. Look at that. Okay, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. So that's where we started, we used our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, so it has obvious design implications there. We found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. When a remote control would look fancy, we were quite surprised by that finding, but that's quite a high proportion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot, so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. Yeah. So again there's power implications there. Fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. And possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. The biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier, remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that. Thirty four percent of people said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury. Those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. The vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. That trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features, that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you, but I think I'll just keep it simple, if there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay? Kay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's fine. Right, we're not going to be using teletext, apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Huh. Okay. It's not going to be a combined control, which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us, but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control? It says for TV only, so looks like it's just I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? Just channel-hopping. It just said, for TV only. Would that imply video use? But general TV controls do video as well. I dunno 'cause if you've. You get combined TV and videos don't you? Mm-hmm, yes. And if you got a Sky box, they have one of those plus boxes, you can record straight off the TV anyway so on to the TV hard drive or so. Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Yes. Yeah. Anything about that on the market research or something regarding whether people want a combined something like that? We didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons, those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare. Mm. Ten Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. So I don't know if that's something we need to look at. Just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. In fact I've just called up that table there, we asked those two questions, the table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate. Alright, okay. Would you prefer an LCD screen, that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control? Alright, okay. So you can see how the yes no sort of varies across the age group there, and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group, I think that's just general fear of new technology. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose, you were saying whistling, maybe on the TV you could put a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote, you go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps. But on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a. Right. Mm. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. That's a super idea. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. So we want fashionable, trendy, what you were talking about with the marketing. People paying more for it to look good. We need to focus on that as well. Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. Yeah. What is attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African, I dunno, you get the idea. Mm. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day, it's the user interface design that may and the sort of fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world. Yeah. Yeah. Are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs? Sure. You could have a number of different designs inside they'd be essentially exactly the same. Alright. Right. Mm-hmm. Just. The features could be same and the body could look slightly different. Yeah. Mm. So. What about you were talking about the buttons, the controls that are coming out now have kind of big, rubber buttons, not tiny little one, big, rubber buttons, but what about, 'cause we got to make it original, what about with the touch screen computers? Kay. That's what I was just. So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either, not sure about the You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it. No, no 'cause you don't actually have to press them you just. Think that might appeal kind of Japan, I'm thinking young, office people, trendy kind of a thing. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes it will appeal to sections of the market Mm-hmm. But quite, easily labelled so that that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, Were too big. Mm-hmm, mm. Mm. But also ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics there's sort of physically different things 'cause if you've ever seen the X Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because they're just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is so if I don't know what 'cause obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others. Mm. Maybe as it was indicated that risk of repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that. Yeah. Yeah. So, a bigger okay so based on not only segment age groups, you're dividing it according to the countries also, the market. Mm-hmm. Maybe for US and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small. Yeah. Hmm. I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The internal engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely. It's gonna be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned, when you read the the RSI issue again, repetitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough, I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements. Yeah. I'm I really can't get my head round this one, this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about. Yeah. I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes. Mm. And it becomes ridiculous, yes I know. Or a speech recognition, which is extremely expensive, I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue. Speech recognition, but. Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Mm. We could focus on the biggest market. Um. Mm. Say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market? And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trendy people. We're talking about the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically associate that with the older generations. Mm. Now with the baby boomers, they have a greater population than us young people, but I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range business kind of class type people. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage, we want to, not waste money, not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up, first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this. Mm-hmm. Okay, so the remote control functions. We've got the video, now I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, yes. Mm-hmm. Video plus. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it, because you've got your general record anyway so if there's a programme on you want to put record on, that's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you put the number in and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just a number. Mm. Mm-hmm. Just whack in the number. And you. And you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that, you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway. No. You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway. Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful. It is after if you look in the newspaper, TV guide or any TV guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times, and it has been around for quite a long time. It's not. Ah. Right. It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things. No it's not but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Mm. Superb. Mm. Mm. Yes. Though if if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series. Right. Excellent, mm-hmm. So that. Mm. But just to have that function would be would be really good. Right. Okay so Mm-hmm. Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, don't to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that's kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with their design features, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, they'll phone the company, you can use their telephones. Yeah. Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, which button is it I press for this? As free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? Mm. But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so the companies who you deal with actually they've got an obligation to help you out and also it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having instruction books I feel I reckon can cover that. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it. Alright. Taking your TV and your control and saying look it's not working, what should I do? Yes If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel, but if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for TV and video, we're not gonna put okay, just a thought. I think so. Instruction manuals. Okay. But there's customer service, there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge, there's no extra, the person has to walk to a shop on the high street. Yeah. Department. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm. Right. Yeah. I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. Yeah. Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that, yes okay. And they should be. Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages. Simple. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious, yes. It's the. It does, you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it, so that should be something we think about. Sure, okay. Mm-hmm. What other functions? I'm not sure if we need a design decision now, but we should think about 'cause you've got the dilemma between batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? They're specially made for the mobile phones, but you could bundle a charger in with it but Mm-hmm. They they last quite a long time, and the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something, but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Something like that should reduce the size of it. And if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could on that as well so. It could be on that okay. Yes. Are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Some sort of docking station or. Rechargeable with a docking station. Mm-hmm. So the rechargeable which would be your field. That'd be fine, and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time. Okay. Yes, which it is cheaper in the long run as well. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. The shape you got trendy. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either, because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how much you try and make it simple, They do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. And so many remote controls look absolutely identical, these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed on the surface. Yeah. We definitely an an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles, we don't want that. Okay so we've got a flip-screen. Okay. Okay. What I was thinking of a design which Nokia came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box, like a chocolate. Yeah. That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, and you don't bend your thumb too much, so it's like can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. Mm-hmm. Slightly curved, curved. Yeah. So what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down. So it's already curled up so we can have moulded according to the way you hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom, something like that. Mm. Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway. Mm. Yeah. Okay. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but smooth. Can you look into the company logo? Things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product. Current. For example, if it was a C or something like that, you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, along those lines to be able to incorporate it obviously into the design, while also making it quite different from anything else that's there. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We could look in at that but Mm. Look at the mobile. Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than sea-shells, logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model, rather than trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were telling like. We need to think about how it's gonna look different. I think that sounds a really attractive idea, I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of and that opens out into your flip-top. A sea shell? Yeah. Then it's nice to you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea and plus even though we're using plastic, think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior. We could look in at that. Or you could do like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. Mm. You could have different kind of casings. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you could have psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle. Mm. Maybe we could come at some say five, six designs and then choose whichever appeals the most like, that could be the most common design. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. But we can think of five, six designs. Right, I think we have to round it up, Sure. Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything. So it's only for TV and by implication video, our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control, something about Videoplus. Mm-hmm. In cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions, making it simpler instead of having lots of things you put in for date It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that. Right. Right. Right, so when they press for programming you it comes up on the LCD, a reminder about using Videoplus? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements, is this just that was an add-on feature? Uh-huh. Right. Right, so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature? It it yes, it could be advertisement feature, rather than design feature, drawing attention to that. Yeah. Right. And it also paid lip service in the instruction manual, 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful. Mm, and the rechargeable batteries. Yeah. Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements? We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at, what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like. Yes. Yes. And we've talked about there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost. For detection, right. Yeah. Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. But there aren't gonna be that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that. I think Yep, and different from what's out there. Yep, I think True. Okay. Yep, I think that's us. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting? Okay. Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved? I think you might get guidance, but I Instruction manuals, 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing, everyone's got a big pile of them, but no one really uses them. Okay. Okay. Um. Whoops, questionnaire four. Oops. Yes, right. Cause we're at lunchtime now I think. Okay. Right, okay. I think you can email me, if there's any more questions. And I'll be able to not answer them.",
