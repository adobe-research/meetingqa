    "displayText": "Okay. Right. Okay. Alright. Is everyone here? Yep. Yep. Okay. This is our conceptual design meeting. And I'll just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes. Then each of you will have your presentation, and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control. And then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up. I'll go through the minutes first. We just refreshed our goal of making the finest remote control available. We know that we need to use company logo. And our Marketing Expert gave us some information from interviews with a hundred different remote users. With some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before. People thought their remotes were ugly, that remotes zap a lot. They only use a finite amount of buttons. And that it's easy to lose a remote. Which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple. And some sort of locator. Either a button or tracking device. And that it should look different than what's out there. Kind of mixed response on the speech recognition. The younger people said they wanted it, older people did not. I think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it, and that it was probably a gimmick, that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves. Then the User Interface Designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote. The simple versus the complex. The simple one being better for a user, the complex better for an engineer. And some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote, something simple. And that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote, because increasing cost and increasing complexity. We would just have a TV remote. And that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote. Have it be something that looks different. And finally our Industrial Designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work. From energy source, what we would use. Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable. How that would power the remote and the lamp. If we were to to have one. The user interface then would connect to a chip, which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the TV. I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be. Something that will fit easily into someone's hand. And with a, just a few buttons. Just the basics. And with a scrolling function also. Okay and I will leave it at that. So Marketing? Okay. We're watching trends. Yep. Can I have your cable please? I suppose that you can have this. Thanks. Okay so I was looking at trend-watching. Unfortunately I wasn't given too much information. I was given a brief executive summary, and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at. And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that. Okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design, which I think we've kind of already discussed before. The second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative. And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up. And thirdly the remote would be easy to use. As far as fashion update, we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote, but we can try. And also, as opposed to this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel. Okay so from that as we've already said, we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel. I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design. But I think that, even if it's very subtle, we need to kind of trick our consumers, so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that. For technologically innovative, we've talked about the tracking device. We brought up the idea of having two pieces, which we could discuss further. And Manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface, discussing some of those, that we could change a little bit. We need to keep it simple, have limited buttons, which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for. We need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables. I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable. It was sort of banana shaped. Yeah. A banana shape? Yeah. Right. Or with exterior designs. But my question is, the stereotypically speaking, you kind of picture males with their remote controls, and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside. So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable, or don't different options for female, male target groups. And then the spongy feel. I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there. And look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls. So that's that. So possibly a sorry, just to butt in for a second. Alright. Possibly a cover like they have for mobile phones? That's what I was thinking. Those sort of spongy ones. You have one with a flag, and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it. Yeah. So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings. You can Mm various covers. What's it called? You personalised. Personalise your remote. We could leave that to the cover department. Yeah. Mm-hmm. We all know they've got nothing to do all day. Okay. Why can't I see the crazy. I talking about the interface concept and how the consumer will use the actual device. So I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent, try and get some inspiration. But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had. I was sent some information from the company saying that the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology, where you can program questions into such devices. They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question, you program the answer, and the machine responds accordingly. Okay. There's different ways of a user can use products like a remote. There's a graphical use, where you look at pictures and on a screen. A command line where you obviously type things in, and you get a response. And then that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent sort of use of interface in remotes. You can't really see that picture but there's various different remotes, once again with lots of different buttons on, making it more complicated. So, then I had a look at new products that are on the market. Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise. There is a voice recognition remote control, which can control multiple devices. I have a there is a picture. You surf your favourite channels with your voice. Store up to eighty speech samples, controls four devices, TV, cable, satellite, VCR, DVD and audio. And you can record your own verbal labels, that are connected to remote control functions. So the technology is there. The one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting, where there has scroll down functions on the side. You can sort of just make those out. And then on the right is obviously an iPod, which is possibly one of the simplest things to use out there, and really is, and all that is just a nice big scroll menu that you sort of go through. That is a possibility. And nothing's simpler really. Then there's things like this, which is a a kid's remote, where the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before. So the remote control it only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch. And it means that children have a novelty of having their own remote control. So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote we just had two components, maybe it can have more components different remotes. The point made at the end there here is that you have to sort of be need to be clear on your devices, as to what, things you use. Sometimes an arrow pointing down, which may suggest volume down, could become confused just as a V for volume. Just little things like that, which would need to be made clear in the design. I think, carrying on from what I've already said, a user friendly remote with minimum buttons. Maybe we've suggested this two-part thing, where if it was to have a speech recognition thing, you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit. And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier, as the actual remote. It could be a graphical display, the actual control port maybe could have an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus. Stuff like gets more and more complicated. And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed. And that is it. Why am I. Just. Where are we? Uh. Just to sort of show you. They've even got things like that. Huge things. Which is just for your ninety year old grandma? That's industrial design for cranes, stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Dunno. And that. Makes sense, makes sense. Notice the giant dog bone shape? Also good for animals. Yeah. See. Things. Why's my screen crazy? Let's see. I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior. Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there, and that we do have to fit the stuff in there. I've more information on possible materials as well. What we can and cannot do. But let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here. Okay. The details of the components' design, as you can see there, what we have is the board, main board of the remote control. The underside, that's pretty cheap piece of technology really top left side you can see the chip, which is what we were talking about, this is the device to recognise the signals the input, and it passes it on to a row of further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal, which is being, transferred to a infrared lamp which then of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it's getting and will do what you tell it. So much for the workings of the remote control itself. Its job is to wait for you to press a key, then to translate that key press into infrared light signals, that are received by the television. When you press a key you complete a specific connection. The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed. It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button. Right. Pretty clear. Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the sends the signal to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light. The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal reacts appropriately. This is the circuit board from the other side. The lower part of it, don't if can see that properly, with the green greenish board is what we saw in the first slide just flipped over. You can see the circuit board itself. That's the cheapest way to make electronic connections basically on the market. What you do is you don't have cables, but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board. These are the actual keys that are being pressed. They close the electric circuit. That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side. That would be behind here. Which sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there. Now as you can see this is the rubber button version of it. The way it works is that you have the keys here. The rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side, which closes the circuit here. And thus gives on the signal. Now this is the simple version. We are talking this the simple and cheapest version at the same time. We are talking something more complicated of course, it's going to be more expensive as well. And not only that. We are also restricted in the use of our outer shell, or in the material that we could use for our outer shell. I've gotten some information that we could use for the case plastic, rubber, as well. Rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls. So it's pretty squishy. That would that would serve that purpose. Spongy? We could also use wood, or titanium. What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium? Fya I don't have an information on that. However our company obviously can provide us with the titanium, so I assume, I was given an okay to use it. It certainly is an expensive material, I'm aware of that, but I was given an okay. But there are certain restrictions to certain materials. Now let's first go through the list with the materials. So we what we can use is plastic, rubber, wood and titanium. Can also mix these. As for the energy source, we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting. What we could use is, or what I was offered, or what we could use, is a basic battery. Right? A dynamo. Interestingly enough. We could use solar cells. Or a device that was not not further specified that provides kinetic energy. Such as watches. Where you just move the actual device and this provides it with some energy. So obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really. Mm. You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right? Solar cell is interesting. May fail though, every here and there. Would you have to leave it by the window? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Or it, lies behind the couch for a week and mm. Yeah. Always you But exactly. Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so No I think batteries are probably the way to go. Probably not. Yeah. The kinetic energy thing might work, but the same problem. You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work. So I'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery. Which also makes a base station basically obsolete. We don't need that then. However our interface options are push-buttons. In the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert. However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option. And they are possible. We have an okay for scroll wheels. Okay. However when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an LCD into the remote control as well. This however may exclude certain materials. If you have a squishy kind of remote control, then an LCD screen may be affected by the movement. Hence we might not be able to put it in there. So There's also restrictions to, when it comes to the chip. If we have a more sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set-up that I've just presented, the chip has to be more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well. I don't have any details to, when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference. I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip, but that's not up to me to decide really. So that's for the for the scroll wheel. It limits our choice and squishy is hip, so I'd say rather not go for that. Let's see now. Solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control. But obviously that's not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells, assume right? Mm. Or is anybody still alright. Yeah. No. Hmm. Alright. Yeah. Which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume. With the titanium we cannot make it a curved design. We would just be able to make it flat and a straight design pretty much. Which I assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions. Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff. Mm. A covering. Yeah. So I don't know if that would still be possible to have in plastic. But then where do people hold it? Just all be sort of spongy. Yeah. The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts, so they can remove it. So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it, like a screen? Like the iPod? You can have an LCD screen. But therefore no rubber will be used. Right. Alright? So yes, titanium yes, but this will of course influence the form. With plastic, as I understand it, you can use any form. Latex is tricky. And titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form. So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular, add an LCD screen, and then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium. Yeah. Or wood even. If you wanna make it a particular shape, use plastic. Add an LCD screen, add a scroll wheel, that'll be fine. Yeah. Or make it just push-buttons. Basically plastic gives you the biggest variety of of options. Maybe not the nicest feel. Or not much originality really. So the wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want? Or the rubbery we cannot? With rubber we could pretty much shape it the way we wanted it, but we cannot add scroll wheels, and we cannot add an LCD screen. Kay. Mm. Mm. Mm. That's the tricky thing. Could we not have a shape with a scroll and the screen, and then just sort of that initial shape we had, just which is sort of banana-esque. So that's thing if we did it yellow. Yeah. And you just stick on just sort of rubber things that sort of grip the thumb bit. They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior. They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing. Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? Certainly can be done yes. If that doesn't affect the functional side of it all. Yeah. Say just the underside or so then it can be done. I assume. Yeah. So The fruit design How about affecting the surface of the actual remote control? Say we don't make it a particular fruit shape obviously, but give it the surface of an orange, banana, whatever. Mm. You name it. Mm. What about a smell? Just design-wise. To the remote? Mm. Nice one. You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose. In different yellows. Bright citrus colours. Mm. I don't suppose we have to stick to the colours. We're supposed to stick to the company colours though, that's yellow and grey. Yellow and grey. Yellow and grey. Lemon, banana, is Grapefruit is what we'd go for, when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps. Mm grapefruit. Grapefruit. But mm. I would say, if I were to make a decision, I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance. Yeah. Perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer. I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous, like we kinda do. Yeah. We have it banana-shaped already, kind of. Yeah. So Right. Yeah. And if it's yellow? And if it if it was done yellow, which is a company colour. It's it's yellow. It's yellow. It's curved. Grey buttons. So why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana? It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes. Yeah. We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over. On the the the rubbery grips could be grey. It would look like a banana just sitting on their table. Mm. Yeah. There you go. Rather than rather Maybe the holder, if we were to have a holder, it could be shaped like a fruit. It could and then you could actually put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl, on the coffee table, and then people would always know where it was. Oh. Nice. Could look like a fruit bowl. It could be an ape. Could be, it could be an ape or a fruit bowl. Yeah. Hey we could have a variety of options here. Yeah. Kay. Yeah. Do you have more to your presentation? That's pretty much it. I informed you about the materials, what the interior has to look like, and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go. Oh. Okay. I'm gonna plug in here real quick. Sure. If I could. Hang on. There you go. Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here. Ow. Ow. So is the two piece idea out? Or have we not decided? We sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery. And the base station might not be necessary. Right okay. We can still design a two-piece remote without having a base, having one of them be a base station, but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions, or you take out the smaller piece. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. We can still do that. However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much. Mm-hmm. Which then, as I understand it, would probably limit the, limit again the the use of certain materials, because they would be too expensive. Say have a scroll wheel on both of them, or have an LCD screen and so on so on. Mm. You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there. Mm. But could be done, of course. Okay. So these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting. For our components concept we need to come up with the energy source, the chip-on-print, and the case. Probably case material. And probably a shape also. And then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the type is. And what kind of supplements we'll have. Energy source I think we've, decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet. Right. And we have five minutes. Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print, as I said, the more advanced features you want, the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. If you want just a normal button version, the chip-on-print is gonna be a cheap one. Mm. Right? Kay. So I guess we should pick the case then. If we go with the plasticky case, or the plastic case, then we could have either or. We could have a complex one or a a non-complex. Yeah. But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us? What about what you said, like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic? Just maybe. Just a little bit of. Okay. So we would, we would have the LCD screen? As long as the rubber is nowhere near the controls, yes. Kay. So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a it's more of a supplement maybe. Yeah. Yeah. More of a lamination perhaps. Yeah. Then for the scroll, are we going for the iPod type? I think so. Yeah? Okay. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right? Yes. It does. Kay. So I guess that, is that, is that about it? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this? Right. Okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes. Here's what's gonna be going on. Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design. Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design. Right. Corrine we'll want a product evaluation. And the two of you get to play with the modelling components maybe and get us a prototype. Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface. So that basically just be working on the prototype, we'll accomplish your other two actions. Alright. Okay. Let's do it.",
