    "displayText": "Hi everyone, hope you had a nice lunch. Um. Alright we're moving on to conceptual design. Scuse me. Bless you. I'll just review what we did in our last meeting. Under marketing we targeted our audience, and. That was generally how helpful that was. Then we considered some design options with how it should look, we discussed an iPod-like button system which, we haven't concluded but we're Right, So, if you all have presentations to do, we can see where you've come from our last time. Does everyone have presentations? Hmm. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Yes. Would anybody like to go first? Sure. Okay. So I've been looking at the components design. Um. Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. So we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard. I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case, to protect the remote and the locator. And we'll need to custom design a circuit board, because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, the iPod-style wheel. The infrared LED is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it. We need a radio sender and receiver, those are standard. And we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. So we have some material options. We can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. And the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case. And why not wood? And? And why not wood? We can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to. And also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a slightly more expensive chip. We can't use the minimal chip, we need the next higher grade, which is called regular. I don't think it's much more expensive, but it is more expensive. So that's what I've got on design. S good. Can I do next? Cause I have to say something about the material which is quite shocking. Hmm. Yeah. Ha. Mm. Right, I have been searching the current trends, both on the web and via fashion-watchers, and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fancy look and feel. Um. Next comes technology and the innovations to do with that. And last thing is the easy to use factor. Fancy look and goes far beyond the functionality of the thing, but I suppose that is included in the ease of use. Our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, noticed, that the fruit and vegetable theme is the current trend and therefore we need to go for that if we want, whatever our motto is. Um. For fashion, we go for fashion. Mm. The fashion in electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, so the the question of our technology is Industrial Designer. As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be, should discuss this together, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables, but that's just a personal opinion. I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room. Those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed, so that still has to do with the material should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit? And finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine. To summarise these are the points that need to be touched in order to get a good decision, and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter. Mm-hmm. Thank you for your attention. So. I think it's the blue one. There we go. Uh. Okay. Um. So that fruit and vegetables thing. I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and So so okay, let me get this right. Neither was I. It's a trend in fashion, in clothing and fabrics. But you're not gonna wear your remote control. Okay, Okay, alright anyway. Here we go. Conceptual User Interface. We're gonna try to talk about, how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. And, basically, so, this is a touch-based graphical interface system. So people are going to be looking at this little screen. Kind of assume, are we still on the screen idea? We hadn't discussed it last time. Cause if we have this in order to have someone going around and using the wheel it seems like you would need a screen. You need a screen for it? You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song, that band or whatever. But if you think about it but if so is it just okay. With TV channels it's, one two three. So. So, you're gonna have to switch to DVD and other things like that, aren't you? We're, actually not having DVD, that was one of I was sorry, I meant to update you on that. Are we Okay. Alright. Okay. Um. But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. Okay. That correct? Okay. Yeah. Anyway we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay. So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? And I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right. Graphical interface? You're you're gonna have to be able to switch to a mode where okay we're not choosing that, I guess. You can have it on the telly though. Yeah. But choose channel control, Because people aren't gonna be able to have channels one two three four five six seven eight nine. Yeah. So that people seems to be. I know what you're saying, you have to But imagine someone with But what if you have satellite and you have two hundred channels. But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels. So I guess that's why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go back and forth and choose if or then again I guess I can see some kind of a thing where you sort of have the number come up on the TV like what channel you're on. You can just scroll and you can just get to five or twelve or? Yeah. My flatmates actually had one with a wheel, and it it did show up on the TV. Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to. Cause you'll have to like but you can. Yeah. They have to wheel really fast. But I think the wheel goes through a hundred channels, at least on theirs. If you do, it so it would have to be you so you basically just kinda need to figure out what kind of, range we need to have on the wheel, So you're you're either doing this motion to control the channels or once once you stop that, you can tap for, different whatchamacallits, different functions like volume or, like you can tap just to get to different channels. Yeah. If you just wanted to go from five to six you could tap And then there's also the concern about how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, or if you want to switch around, don't these different modes turn on the timer or something something like that, like would too, So and it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it, you know, because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that, is just there. Right. With that many options, I'd think that the screen would be better, because you could have that menu option, sort of. Yeah. It's more expensive according to the design people. Uh. That's the only thing though. You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing, You can get to you can maybe it'll be that central button that, then you hit that and then it brings up the menu on the TV and you can just scroll around, to do the timer, to do the. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So the TV is the screen, So it would have all these different options of changing to Okay. Yeah. But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up. Look it even has settings. Hmm? On the you can just take theirs and just but should be comfortable. Yeah. We don't want the screen guess, 'cause it does seem like, that would be, incredibly expensive, but dunno, and then so, it just really all you need is, this little wheel then, and you can control everything. Yeah. So. Right. What if if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the physical attributes, and you just have this, it's just a long silver thing, or whatever we're thinking. Are you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? Or. It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides and the power button could even hold down the menu button for longer than one second and it turns on the TV. Can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. Okay. Yeah. Definitely. I think we're looking at something that could be, even maybe like a I'm seeing almost a circular sort of handheld thing. It needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to manipulate and use your how do I'm not really when I use an iPod, I end up just kind of using my index finger to control it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb. So. I use it like that. Or your thumb or something. When we had the wheely remote control, it was on the top if you held it like that. So. Yeah. Yeah. So Mm. But, were there buttons on there as well? It had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do. Mm. Yeah. So we just used the top part. Yeah. But I think it could be pretty small. Uh. I mean, you want it to be large enough that you can But can't you just get But, do you need that? What if, you had a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to change the contrast or something like that? So the options are there but they're not interfering with the design and the practicality of it. Do do you know what I'm talking about though? Yeah. Just something that you can flip over. Maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of. You can have it on the settings, no? If you can get to, so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the TV screen. I guess that's the thing is if we can do this, that'd probably be. That keeps it really. I don't I just don't think you would even need it. So Mean you can do it, it's it doesn't seem that hard. So I guess we have to look into the, programming, how they actually programme these things, and if that's. How they make the menu show up on the TV? I don't know. Would that would be. They already do it. I believe it's it's gotta be inside the TV, not inside the remote. I've never bought a remote. I'm not sure. It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television, which is a little I've never bought just a remote, so I don't really know. They usually are. I guess that's right. No. So, but I've never had a hard time with my remotes, like bringing up the menu screen if you need to change the date or whatever. It always comes with the TV. And I don't think that should be too hard. Most of the ones we've had have had the menu button, 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to change the contrast or something. Yeah. Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something. Yeah. So do we need dunno. I guess we have to think about But you just basically need the output signal to be able to bring it up. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. That's what it does anyway. But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out, because the problem with buttons is you they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand, and I never get it. Yeah. Yeah. You don't know they mean, it's. Yeah. Never ever. On the telly. But you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen? Or on the TV too. On the telly, okay. So I think, I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really cool idea because it is so obnoxious to have to push those okay now you have your little guide out and you're hit this button twice, to activate the date. Mm. Mm. And it is technologically innovative in a way, so that fits with the. Yeah. I guess. And the iPods are really hot right now, by web research, so. Did you did you get that picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web? That's quite interesting. What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading? God. I was gonna say. You said people want spongy. One of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in those stress ball things. Yeah. Yeah. So, that would be spongy. Okay, that would be cool. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Just nice feel, but I hate spongy. That would be kind of usually the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic mouse type, thing. Yeah. Yeah. But what if we had a spongy sort of stress balley kinda so you're like Or what if we integrated the the what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely we tapped into that, so it feels like a vegetable. Definitely the area round it. I think it could work. Yeah. It could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover. An orange. Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana. Yeah. If it's a small thing, instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana, which frankly I'm not particularly fond of, you could just have covers and then it's like a mobile phone thing. There was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could do the computers where they have the grapefruit, apple machine and they have the blueberry, all the colours are named after fruits. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could name it after fruits and vegetables, or. And the colour can fit your sitting room, so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry, and then if you have a green one you can have don't. Um. So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking. So I think colours. If you have that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, so what you're feeling is comfortable, then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. Yeah. Yeah. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. Yeah. Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours. Yeah. How are you all envisioning by the feedback we've just got about A ball? Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables. I I dunno. That's in the shape of a fruit, like a. Maybe a ball. Know, a squashy ball. A relaxing squashy ball. That I see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a sticker sort of? Yeah. Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, like a okay. This is just Okay. Say that's the say that's the squashy bit. Squashy. I was thinking of getting a cover for Which is cheaper. See sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and that's your actual thing. I don't know if it's cheaper actually. Oh. Mm. And like this you could have cherries and things around there. I like that shape. Yeah. But I was thinking if it was this 'cause the way you were describing the iPod and the roll thingy It's almost like your thumb is farther up, so if you could squish it lower then I know what you meant. I was thinking sort of a single ball shape. Yeah. So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a Mm-hmm. It's it has to be. I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. So it wouldn't be very big in either how big? This big, and then you just do that, I suppose. What if, the squishy, so you're saying the squishy part's detachable, and you can so so maybe one you can have the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have the banana squishy thing and you could have your choice? Just a I can't like condom thingy, like a cover. But the question is, which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that, and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that, and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then try and ask users what the best is, and No. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh. Um. That's nicer. I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater. Yeah. Hmm. Um. That's not very neat, but Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think the I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part. If it's a bit like those juggling balls, you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it. You could squish it. If it's got sand in it maybe, or something, you it it just moulds to your hand. Yeah. Yeah. So where are the fruit and vegetables now? We we don't know. Fruits and veg. I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the rest is the company the company colour's silver? It was, silver and yellow. It looks like I don't. We could promote the banana one. Okay. Mm. That's another question, where are we gonna we should have the logo somewhere on it. Mm. Mm-hmm. Should also fit the batteries, which we haven't Okay. Yeah. I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. And that would that Mm-hmm. Yeah. Especially if you're switching out the squishy part. Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off. Mm-hmm. I think, it'd be interesting to have the squishy bit. The part that you, can change into the different, trendy vegetables and fruits. But it. I dunno. You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand. Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again. No but it does it automatically. Does it automatically? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me. Okay. But if someone components concept. Question mark. Energy. Question mark. That was me. Was that you? Yes. Okay. Right right. Yeah. What but what do we know about energy? We're gonna use batteries right? We actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo, which is something don't what it is. And I think batteries sound good. Something to do with torches. Ah, it's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. It's the it's like if if something moves, when it moves, it stores energy. Okay. The other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. So I sort of picked battery. It's quite sweet. We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power. But I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways. It seems a little weird for a living room anyways. What does everyone else think? No. The dynamo would be interesting. But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it it creates energy on its own. Oh. What about Kryptonite? Which is quite cool. So if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite I find them annoying. But we need to find cost. Yeah. Don't know the cost. Didn't have enough data to actually All it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. Does anyone have costs on the on the web? It didn't give me any actual cost. Okay. Right. Hmm. Mm. Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk. So I don't think it's that much of a problem. The chip is probably the most expensive part. What does chip on print mean? For things like remote controls, they stamp out a chip, calculators too I think. Uh-huh. So you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap. Okay. But you can't reprogramme your remote controls, it's like stamped onto the chip. Right. So, chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced. Yeah. Okay. And case? I guess that's what we've been talking about. Case is what we were discussing. Casing. Yeah. Thinking of syntactic case and let's see. Is there anything else we need to talk about? Hmm. When we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough. And working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design. And you're gonna be doing product evaluation. So you'll get mm more instructions from your personal coach. Thank you. Mm. Cool. See you soon. Does it matter that I end early? How how early is it?",
