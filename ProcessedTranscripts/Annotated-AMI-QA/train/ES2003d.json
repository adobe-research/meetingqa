    "displayText": "That should hopefully do the trick. Kay. Sorry about the small delay. Falling a little bit behind schedule. And that's fifteen twenty five. Okay. So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, we're gonna go for something how was it? The new black, I believe. Something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, though we should never avoid functionality, of course. Many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an LCD display. Other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. Okay. So due to your hard work, we might as well let the two designers go first, and show us the prototype. Okay, it's a if we both step up and outline our ideas. Quite how the best way to do this. Okay. Now doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. For one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is down here for the LED. As it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick, though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for just a thought. You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be twisted round, sticky so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other. But as you see with holding it in the left hand, the LCD is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design. Now I got your note about keeping the cost down. I'm afraid. Yeah. We'll go into that a bit more, but please go on. This design could be done with plastic casing. Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. As for the single curve, this edge and this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it's not absolutely necessary. Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this. And you have the transmitter here and a wee speaker for the for the for the remote control finder. So. Any further comments? Obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks, because it's gonna be flat on one side, so the LCD will be sticking down like this, won't it? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Cause it you can't get it curved. Because of costs. The. And it's plastic as well, so it won't be as comfortable on the hand. Mm. Yeah. With the rubber design it could pretty much mould very much to the user's hand. One nice wee feature if we could still do the rubber, I though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the rigid substructure. So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely. Mm. Lovely. Um. Yeah. Okay. Great. Right. Um. I've got a if you load up my evaluation document. Okay. Okay. Excellent work. Mm. Um. Evaluation. Basic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. Then it's a seven seven step kinda evaluation process. So not seven scale. So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that and that will give us some type of confidence in our prototype. And the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those I put together from the user requirements phase. Kay. If you flip the So, those are the criteria. And perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points. Put it mildly. So we have true? One, Seven, eight. Fourth. Okay, so we have to go through each point. If we imagine it's actually straight, and just give it a a score. How well would you say the prototype is how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. Is the homing thing still the locator, is that still Sure. That's still part of the design. And Adam, we can keep that in? I believe so. So I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost, 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element, but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have. Okay. Sure. Sure. Mm. Mm. And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple. Mm. Bright colour. So we still have that noise thing? Mm-hmm. On a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? I'd say number one. Number one? One. Yeah. Okay. Number number one for the first criteria. I think if it was just the sounder then something I've found with say trying to find a cordless phone or a mobile, you can hear it, but you can't quite pin it pin down where it is. You can tell what room the mobile is. What if the volume on the TV's turned up massively and you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote. Yeah. Suppose you have to go to the TV and do it manually. Mm. Mm. Yeah. You wouldn't hear the speaker. Just before we go through all of the steps here, what we'll do is if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright. Mm-hmm. You wanna say something? That's fine. So is there anything here that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered? That's fine. And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. What do you mean is there anything I wanna a few. Is there any of these criteria that need any explaining? Or is there anything that yous thought really would stand out compared to the others? Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion. So they say we put the fashion in electronics, they they're very big on fashion, so. Okay. That's this bit right here. And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, so it's kinda condensed into one. And we can come back to it, you said. So. Okay. No which we will do very very shortly. Um. Okay. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Most of it stems from the use of the LCD which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well. The only way to get this down was either to ditch the LCD, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna require more buttons, etcetera. Or what we did was that we as in as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs and we're just scraping it in, we've got point two of a Euro left over there. So we're just managing it really. Even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a USB connection is definitely not viable now. Um. Different languages? That should still be viable. We've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the LCD. So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility. Yeah. But what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here. We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be. Um. I can bring the excel up sheet up and show you if you wish. I really think as much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the LCD wouldn't be in this perfect place. It might be stuck slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person. Mm-hmm I suppose one thing that could be done is have it circular and have it so that the actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger. Okay. Mm. Mm. So Mm. It very much is about making concessions, unfortunately. Um. Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? Can you get the entire thing printed with a design? Is you mean on the plastic, or? Let's have a look. You now have as much information as I do. Um. So as you can see here, for example, the battery really not very little choice in that one. We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to. I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. Plastic for some reason incurs no cost, which I've had to very much make advantage of, despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit. Problem comes here as you can see in the interface. If I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. That might make sense, because then a numeric keypad would come in at what, four point five Euros, which is an awful lot, so that could well be wrong. Even if we save point five there, it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit, which has had to be put to one side. As you can see, the use of an LC display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick. Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together? That's quite significantly expensive. I that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters. As you can see that's taken up well over half of the price. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go, because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the price for what we really desired, this one comes in under price as you can see, but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design. We don't even have speakers here. We what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? Have we factored that in? Mm. No, it literally would just be a button. Transmitter, receiver, speakers. Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a TV. Is that gonna be a button, or. That's too expensive isn't it? It looks like almost nothing Mm. Good call, I missed that. I mean it's not on here, but. That's a very valid point. Did they do we have to use an advanced chip for the LCD? Yeah. Okay. That's. So if we're gonna go with the LC display, then I believe so. What's a hand dynamo? You have to wind it up? That would probably not be in keeping with the fashion statement and such. Technology. Fashion. Yeah. Okay. So basically the only new thing is the LCD on the remote now. Being manipulated by the joystick. And joystick. Which I'm defining as scroll wheel. Um. And we couldn't replace the joystick, right? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it, up down left and right, and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward? Mm. It's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be, that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation. So The LCD basically is the big selling point of the remote. If we remove the LC display, we could save ourselves a fair amount. Which you could It's a shame. But that's what makes it original though, isn't it? Mm. Yeah. I think if we remove the the LC display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Does this bear in mind that it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it, like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components. We should possibly have If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to. Again, you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one. Mm. But for the purposes of this meeting, we're gonna have to stick with these figures. Kay. So, I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the LC display 'cause it's about what really separates us, despite the cost it's gonna incur. I think so. Are people maybe not happy with, but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case, to keep the LCD? Mm-hmm. One thing, how much extra would it be to keep the articulation? It's hard to tell. I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation. This is what I'm wondering. Yeah. No, I think that it needn't require it to be double curved. It can still be single curved, but You just. It's just it's just it's just that the case would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation. Single curved with articulation? Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface? Cause we have restrictions on software? That's what we need for the joystick though. But there has to be joystick. Mm. And if you look closer at the prototype here, the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight. On the LCD although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done without curves. But the curves all over hand, is it? The curve that's really needed is up here, to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand. Okay. Sure. Okay, my bad. We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway, so for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation. Mm. Unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal. I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria. Which is what we can get onto now. As long as so are we gonna say we have to keep an eye on the time as well, but we're gonna say single curved design It could well be, but at a cost of Okay, we'll definitely won't go with that one. Wait a minute. Sample speaker? What is a sample speaker? Is that somewhat similar to what we want? Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about. Costs four. Yeah. But I thought it was just completely pointless. You got a email about voice response? Yeah. I did not, so. Alright. Basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could, say hello to, and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice. We won't go with that one, did you say? We Okay, okay. That's voice recognition, so. Um. So, okay battery definitely, It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros. So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole locator thing. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Maybe even pretty much point two Euros, I'd say. Mm-hmm. So we'll leave that one for now. It's a case of I'm slightly unsure. Are we going for a special colour at all? One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right. So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more. Um. Mm. I was for a case. At which point if you got point five there. Or had you already incorporated that? Special colour for the case. It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct. I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button. Mm-hmm. Okay, let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least make it a little harder to lose. There we go. Because most most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room. What's the default colour? White or black? Black's probably the normal colour you'd say. Or grey. Right. I quite like that colour that you're fetching there, it's definitely for make it glow in the dark even better. Yellow. Yeah. Will we go with that then? Okay. Yeah. And we can see we'll come back to your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go. Sure. Okay. Okay. So Right okay. Just to give you an idea, you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well, I'm not sure how much time. We've not hit the five minute warning yet, but. Okay. Think it's ten minutes left. Ten. Kay. Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Um. Okay. Special colour. Special colour. Mm mm four? Four. Three? Mm. Three if we're being generous, I feel. Three. I think we can do three. Three. Think we're being generous here with three. The special colour would make a difference. It's lost in a big pile of crap, it stands out from the rest of the crap. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Reduce the number of unused buttons. We're down to two buttons, is it? Two buttons. Two buttons and a joystick. Okay, so that's a one. Where that's Okay, that was good. Totally. Yeah. I'd say we're doing well there. Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus that's good. Kay that's we're not doing so badly. Easy to use okay, let's forget that one. Mm-hmm. Fancy looking. As he models the I'd. It doesn't get much fancier. Sure. And we could do whatever we like with the L LCD. Let's just assume it's a good LCD display. Maybe I was panicking for no reason. Are we going one on? I'd say we go two, 'cause the fanciest would be the double curved. Maybe you'd be a bit too. Wouldn't it? Mm. With the articulators. There we go. That's that's better too. With bells on it. More accurate numbers. Technologically innovative. We're getting rid of the locator thing which. Which is a shame. Mm. I'd give it a three for this for that. No need for teletext. Yeah. The menus thing is something you don't normally see on a remote, but you see it in a lot of other places. Kay. Mobile phones. Mm. And what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control, so say three? Mm-hmm. I might go as far as two on that. Three. I'd give it a three. I'd be tempted with three. Three. Okay. Okay. We'll get panned on the next one, anyway. Materials that people find pleasing. Sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. It is. Don't blame them. Because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such. Yeah. Plastic, it sucks. But it's no worse than any of the other remote controls we have. That's true. It's not a step backwards. Mm-hmm. Five? Six? I'd I I'd give it a six, to be honest. Six. Okay let's give it a six. Okay, that's totally thrown everything off balance. Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. We could. What colour were we gonna make it? Put a leopard print on it. I would say give a selection of colours. We went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow. But by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg. If I were buying one, I'd go for purple. Leopard print would be cool. We gotta. I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that, that's that'd stand out. Yellow. It would also help keep the product placement. Logo, brand. Mm. Mm 'kay. But they're referring to the fruit and veg thing. Is it inspired by clothing fashion? Is this a banana type colour? Could we stretch no still, it's not shaped like a banana is that 'cause it's flat? Yes. It probably it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg, so, what, four? That's kinda it won't be when it's been budgeted. What is what fruit or veg is flat? I think I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie. Yeah. Um. Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well. Yellow courgette. Four? It's very ambitious. Is that being too generous? Mm. I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. Dear. Sure. Is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. Inspired by. I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually. This what we're gonna this is their motto, like. Yeah. And we're we're not doing well on it. This is their strategy. I imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks. Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one. What would you think yourself? I would say it's not at all, right? In any way or shape or form. Okay, the yellow banana like thing is okay. It's kind of curved and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. It's got a curve to it. Right five. Is that sound reasonable? Do you think I'm stretching the use of the banana? I'll go with five. Five. Yeah. Kay, so we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. Which gives us an average of three. This would be in the middle. So it's it's not bad. It's in the good section. It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen. Oops. Sorry. Um. I'm I'm sorry. And you've knocked batteries out. Right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive even based on the four of us being heavily biased, it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing. S bad design, that thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Even if we were to increase this entire thing by seven, we were to go down a grade to four, we would have to do we weren't that kinda optimistic too overly optimistic. We didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things, so I think we're definitely on the good bit. Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven, that's still only three extra points over seven. We did it it was okay. Mm. It was good. Personally, I think given that the product only replaces a single remote control that you've already got, are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good? It depends who's what the target people are, like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going, look at that,'s cool, it's yellow, looks like a banana, it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room. Maybe it's been targeted Hide it in the fruit basket. Mm-hmm. Rather than the LCD whereas more technical more people with the latest technology it's got an LCD screen's only got two buttons and a joystick. So, which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it? Probably the people technologically. They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff. I think so. My mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone, and she's had it for a long time. She uses it to make phone calls and that's it. Yeah. So I think if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick, that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy. Mm-hmm. She'd be is this a remote control, how do you use it, and stuff like that. So even if it is really user friendly to us, but we're used to using menus all the time. Mm-hmm. I suppose one thing is that because it's technically innovative, for someone who's sort of technophobic, the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's totally radical to have a remote control with no numbered buttons. Um. Yeah. Yeah. But radical good, maybe. Okay. Don't know how much longer we've got. At least five minutes I think. Quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation. Um. So, we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction. Do you have any opinions on any of them? For example we'll work backwards I suppose. The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with. People made good use of the pen and paper? I would say I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. Got notes and doodles. Yeah. Wrote nearly a page, but not. I think tracking. I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the researchers studying this. Mm. It's all goes into their corpus. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer our paper notes onto the computer ourselves. It must It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes. That woulda been pretty good. So maybe this is literally just a way around it. I dunno. How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? Good. I liked it. Leadership. As much as can be leadered in this thing. Very good. Top marks. Last one we've got is room for creativity. Now, I think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. Until accounts came along, squish. We're bursting with creativity. That was not the problem. Not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. Mm-hmm. It's a bit of a pity. I would have to agree on that. I think we needed a larger budget. Yeah. If you're going to aim your product maybe at the technological kind of sector, then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is. Because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market. Yeah. Mm. I mean I think to retaining the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in added expense. Mm. And it was twice the assembly cost. And would it have to be twice that? It could be like coulda had the assembly maybe fifteen Euro. That's true. We'll still settle for twenty five. Maybe. I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up at a different group at guess. As to a the costs involved. But we've got a prototype. Such as it is. So I dunno, I think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and such. Maybe the counts woulda been better if we had a list or more to begin with. In the beginning. Yeah. Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end, I would have to agree. Yeah. It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. Always hard to tell until you know the costs. Um. Okay. Are the costs within budget? They are now that we have our slightly less than capable product. Okay. We've evaluated it, and we can say that we came out with a value of three. Yeah. Actually I want one thing I would say something that could perhaps be part of mm the product testing market research process would be to produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the going over-budget would make to sales. It's? And response from consumers. And we could even market two versions. Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber. And then the final one where you get to call it Hal. But we'll go into that later. Yes. Sure. Right is there anything else that anybody would like to add, anything they think that's not been covered, before I quickly write up a final report. I dunno, we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be, but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers. Yeah. There is a huge market. We've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add, we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such. And I can get my bus. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's Thank you. Thank you for your participation. Thank you. I was actually kind of upset at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff. It's man, we can't have the locator thing. And that's just bad. Do you think maybe the prices were were made? That a question we can ask.",
