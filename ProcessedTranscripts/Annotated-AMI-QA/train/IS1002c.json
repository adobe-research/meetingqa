    "displayText": "Afternoon guys. It's gonna be. Rock and roll. Oh. Kay. So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on? Think Mm. We may do. Okay, can he get it all by himself this time? I dunno, I'm feeling like a big boy. Probably not, 'cause he's been listening to too much. So I believe I can fly. He's getting retarded. Alright we got some exciting stuff for you guys. Yay. Or not. Or not. Yeah. Just what I needed was something exciting. Remember, I'm an old man. Kay, ready to go? All ready. Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting. Apparently I'm old as well. Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now. Thirty's really young, eh? We do. Exciting ideas. Kay so here's our agenda our agenda. I'm gonna open. I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do. I'm gonna take some notes. We're gonna all do a presentation, and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now. Yep. Alright. When I say hopefully, we have to. So I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions. And does anyone really want to go first? I guess I'll go first. You two? Yeah. What's Components design. Component, I think. Yeah. Yep that's it. Presented by name. My name is. Jose he man is. Your name is name? My name is name. Hi name. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Sorry I did this in a bit of a rush. Prepare to die. Name. So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control. Right. You've got a printed circuit board here, and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate we've all broken a remote control. We've all broke a remote control. I just love you tech guys. So you've got your chip here, your batteries here, and some sorta electronics. So here's here's a transistor, and this amplifies your signal, you've got the LED here on the end of the printed circuit board. They just do jabber. There's a thingy and a dingy and Nah. You press this and it does I dunno who and whatnot. You've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot. So exactly. So we've got a in this drawing in this example here, this is a eighteen pin chip dunno. Yeah. It's two double A batteries. This is pretty standard remote. So here are options for our power sources. You can use a basic battery, which we've already discussed, our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that. I don't know if that's really I don't know we got some crazy guys down there in that department so You shake it. Kay. I wanna change that. Okay. I gotta I gotta flashlight, but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this. Like this. Yeah. So that's the next bullet is the kinetic provision of energy, so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it. And that's on the camera. Yeah. Kay. We've got solar cells, which I don't think is a very good idea because you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense. Mm 'kay. And finally we've got our cradle our power cradle idea. Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here? Battery versus cradle is. Okay. I like the kinetic. So we have battery versus cradle It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it as a novelty, just to be actually serious for a minute here, you could Mm. I I I figured you would. It could be fun. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It is more it is more eco-friendly than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle. So our case design. Hmm. We have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do. Our material choices are a plastic latex or plastic, a rubber latex type thing, wood, or titanium. If we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium, and wood I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote, it's just anti-technology really. Wood wood would would give us a little bit of a marketing niche, wouldn't it. Nah. It it. Okay. Hmm. To me in a marketing sense it's not relative. We can we can accentuate whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it. Right. And what we may be able to do, and this might be the best option is to combine a couple of these. Okay. My recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a rubber outer shell, to make it to a thick plastic inner shell and a kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable, and also maybe I think it feels a little better than the plastic. Kay. Do you get a good grip on the rubber? Okay. And if you make it from that super rubber, when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand. You don't even need to lean down to get it. The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is we'll have a lot more options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want. And then we can cover the breakable bits with rubber But basically these are curved and double-curved I believe that the tech department, in their message to me, that they were referring to the number of curves in the bottom. Okay. I have no idea exactly what they're talking about, but that's what they told me, uncurved, flat, curved, or double-curved. Okay. I would guess this pen would be kinda like a double-curved, where it's curved on multiple axes, right? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces. Okay. I have no idea. I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a that's what. Mm-hmm that's that's what I see. Okay a wave, okay. That's what I see also. Alright that makes sense okay. Okay, with the interface we have the following options, we can use push buttons, we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button, and LCD display, or multiple scrolling wheels. Ooh. So these are all options that the user interface guy has at his disposal to put together a user interface. Okay. For electronics, we have these very technical descriptions here. A simple chip, which is the least expensive, but have no numbers to give a regular chip, which is the medium porridge the medium expense Yes the difference is, with a simple chip a simple chip will operate why doesn't this scroll up? Do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip? Previous okay. A simple chip is required to operate push buttons. An advanced chip is required to operate the LCD display, and it didn't say specifically, but I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels. Okay. Okay. But. That makes sense. That's the end of my presentation. So presentation from guess design would go best. Next. Technical functions or interface concept? I think No. Interface concept. That's it. Very long presentation. Yes, but it has your name on it. That doesn't bode well for it for it as well. So, somehow that thing's too big, but okay our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition. They say they could put it to work but we don't think so. No. It it you'll be affected by the other speech and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore, and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep. If the TV is working. If somebody says up in the middle of a television show, it's gonna change the channel. Then why don't you just press the up button? But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize? So if you pressed it and went, up? That kinda would. Man. That would kind of lose it. But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go Up. That's right. Even still there's gonna be there's there still will be interference from the TV. It might not be it might not be completely confusing, but I think you'll still it's still I don't think it's practical at all. Okay. I think it's a bad idea frankly. So taking that away, the the the rubber rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the ones that would allow us to market our product as being less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls. Okay. You guys know your stuff. As for the point that we making about losing it. We wanna small remote control one side because we want it to be cool and designed, but apparently market shows that bigger remotes get less lost, about But I think we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that. That I would believe. Mm-hmm. Mm. Somehow. So the what I would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to the right of that slide but with a less complicated design, so the numbers, the volume control, and channel control, and teletext access. The volume and channel control can just become the the four button array if it was a round dial. Mm-hmm. And if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext. So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume? No it's just four buttons that are on a cross, so that you basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone. That's not a scroll wheel. Nah. Okay okay. I see. Right. Instead of play, stop, rewind, and fast forward there, that's up, down, louder, and quieter. Okay. Okay. So I think we go for something mid-sized, so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost. That be it. Kay. So on to functional requirements or trend watching? I dunno. Trend watching has a later date there. Trend watching I guess. Trend watching I believe. Forty six nineteen fifty seven. See what it looks like. Yep. It's been so long. I don't know what to say. When I when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it. I see so many of 'em out there. There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. Are you talking about the picture? That's not our that's not our design, that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like. Okay. Okay. Okay 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet. And from talking to Mike is that we have we can market a more expensive product now. Mm. That's what I understand so, hello. Upper management said yes. Excuse that, that's a bit of spam. And so I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what is it that I'm gonna market? Without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. I like the idea of the scroll there are so many people making these products at this price right now. What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique? What's special and unique about a scroll? It's I just see it as different. It's cool. Mm I don't say it's special. I say that it's different what I'm looking for as marketing is give me something different. Give me a lower price, give me a higher price, give me some new technology, don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's at the same price. I need something to market about this thing. We're we're a new firm. I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though, then we have that as well, but with a similar Mm. What when we have when we have something like the cradle or something that's as a marketing standard I need something to market, to make this product unique. Right I think the two big points that we have so far are having the cradle and also having the actual design of the case itself having this rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior, having it look really nice and also be really durable. Yep. Mm 'kay. Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here. Right. And so so when we have a cradle, when we have some kind of design, what I'm saying is, from my perspective, I don't have a product to market right now. Course. Yeah. My personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost, either lower or develop an integrated new technology. That's that is the next step, there's technology and then there is technology, which we're moving into the next phase. cause that's. And so we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability. Again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet. Mm. So I need a product. Mm 'kay. Let's get a product then. I need a product to market. And I just whatever product you guys put together, we'll find a way to market it. That I'm not concerned with. Now So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle? If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost. Do we go basic or do we go for features? Does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first? My question is what would the scroll wheel do? Function-wise, what does that do that. But that was in your presentation so what would you imagine it doing? Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons. It's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do. Mm 'kay. But dunno. So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique. Yeah. If it creates something more complex or more expensive, then I don't know if that makes it a marketing necessity. But again, from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're it's a very competitive market. What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make. Yeah. They are gonna be more expensive, but on the other hand, it is an alternative if you think that's gonna sell some if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it, but if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for channels up and channels down. So I I like the idea of basically focusing my personal preference is focusing the product on the idea of the case the dock to put it in to charge it. Or do you think volume would be No we can do multiple scroll wheels but Mm-hmm. I'll bet first in volume maybe. I dunno. We can target environmentally friendly ideas, that sorta things. Mm-hmm. It's easy to differentiate the product, so. I think it's that's right. I think so. And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because the whole product's gonna need to be more durable thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often. It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle. Mm. So if we can market it in terms of that So our big decision then is we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on not exactly the details, but do we have What type of casing? Yep. I think we got some exclusivity in that, we got something that nobody else has right now, and that means we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness. Yeah. I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber. Mm-hmm. I'm thinking something kinda almost like these pens, where you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like fused the plastic with rubber on the outside. Okay. Just a very thin sorta sheet for a grip, sorta thing or for Okay. No maybe a bit more then is on here but just as a kind of an inspiration, these pens are kind of Or from my perspective I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing you're not gonna get any information back from the television, so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information, there. Then if we want to do anything more basic more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons, or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go LCD? Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it? It's only a TV. Hmm. It receives no information. Okay. So I I don't see any reason for having an LCD 'cause it's an increased cost. Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it. Yeah. Right now there's nothing coming out of the TV to receive, so unless technology changes and information starts coming out of a cable box or something I don't see the, necessity of an LCD either. Right. Don't see it. Okay so the question is now I guess you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing. So, what we need to know in terms of marketing and project management are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this? What what overall things have we not decided on? I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the user interface is gonna be. There's the scroll wheel, in or out? What do you guys like in the user interface? I think maybe in terms of marketing, is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost? Again. I think it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product, the easier it is, believe, for me to market. Again the push-buttons I see are everywhere. And so we can go with the same thing, but we're gonna be competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique. The other thing I thought about was do we go to something like this? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote. It's just an idea, and don't what I see one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is, when you got children, their stuff gets inside the circuitry, they get dirty, they get messy with drinks and stuff. I dunno about the flip-phone idea, because I think, as far as durability it's not a big maybe when it's closed. Mm-hmm. This And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But you guys are the ones that have to ultimately create the product within cost. And I guess the question that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that as a very different product, or do we really need the scroll wheel as well? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost. Okay phew. Yeah. I think you gotta get into cost effectiveness. I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator, I think those are two very strong features, if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost. The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter, which will we're probably gonna have to go with a medium chip, I would imagine. Mm-hmm. That's gonna is that gonna need a better chip as well? No it's just different. But we I we will need a receiver, an antenna. Integrated. Yeah. So I think that's I know personally that would be a very attractive feature, is to have a button I can push to find my remote control. It should be a really simple signal though so That's true. And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep. But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap, it's not gonna need quality, is it? It's Makes your living room more fresh as you watch. It'll be really cheap. Or maybe you can have a smell-o-rama, you push a button and it puts out a stink. You can. Maybe not. Okay we're doing well for time here. Yeah. We've got about another ten minutes. I think that Mm my personal preference is out. So the scroll wheel, in or out? I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that, and I don't think it's obvious and natural how it would be used. I think we have and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing, 'cause it it breaks down easier. Mm. Yeah. For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad. I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be, but I think he does have a point, it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else, when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels. I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that. But then that surely depends a little on the TV because some TVs are quite slow at changing channels from so if you've got a scroll wheel and you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the TV's ability to change channels. Yeah. Sure. Or do you have to go through and you wait for it? You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to Mm. I think what it would be is the this, where it's maybe a digital wheel, where it's quantized into certain That was my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be. I see. That's where Ah I see I see what you're talking about now. Yeah. Okay. It's just it's basically it it's just a look and feel thing. It has the same exact functionality as two buttons. I think that there are so many people today that are surfing are television surfers, and I see the scroll as a great mechanism for surfing. Instead of going you just you'd. If you're just sitting there going That's kinda cool actually. Yeah. I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing. I like that. Now just so though you did bring up a point which is very valid, is the TVs won't respond exactly the same. Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching, so you may queue up fifteen channel changes, and it'll be flip, flip, flip. That's right. But Right. Not necessarily. You could basically make it so that it's just gonna be sending a signal to the TV the TV's so if you send about five flip channels, if you did that it's gonna flip once. If you do that. It just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want, but I think once people get used to it I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though. Other than click click click. Yeah. And if we're marketing it as a high niche product, then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good TVs as well, presumably. Mm-hmm. I think so. Primarily. I I think so. Yep. Now the only thing I on the interface side of it, is that I I see the dilemma. But if we have the option of scrolling at any particular speed, or the option of jumping direct, okay. Mm-hmm. So I can go presuming I have, on my television, something that tells me what channel I'm on, I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two. I know what because it's on the television. The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it. So I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a problem, 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button. Mm-hmm. Okay? So can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system? You understand what I'm saying? I think I know what you might be getting at, or what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just roll through your favourite channels, and it Why? I see so maybe if we had an LCD up the top that just did a number on it, right? No we could read it from the television. And then it that basically Mm. That's quite cool. You'd need a display on the the thing. It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the TV. The television can tell you. Yeah. Can. No I see what you're talking about. That's kinda cool. How would you program it though? It's one extra button. You say programme start, and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually. Put And then. Okay okay. So programme start, zero, one, enter, zero, five, enter, thirty eight, enter, programme end. Okay and that just basically flips between it and it sends out zero, five, and then thirty six, and then zero, one again. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's kinda cool. I like that. And again we have another another great marketing tool. We have about three we have three or four things here. That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really. Mm-hmm. You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply. I dunno and we maybe even have this as in-house technology. Yeah. This may be something that's available through our own services. Might be, but that's not gonna be such a costly feature. The problem we're gonna have is making it robust. We also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes, between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one, up two. Making it last. Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one, we go this way for the other. So if there's a button for each type. No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels. People are gonna have their favourite sorta, whether they do that or the mode switch. Ah-ha okay. Okay, okay, then you have, a you have a mode switch. Right. I think we'll need a mode switch, but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator to which, an LE an LED okay. Just the lights behind the buttons. You could have back-lit buttons maybe. Would that work? Yeah. Is that okay we have five minutes. Okay. Right details that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel. We want a mode indicator. We want back-lit buttons. And if we're making back-lit buttons period, do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time, so that if it's actually pressed or not. I've seen some remotes do that. Okay. Just so I think it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range. It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range. I think we are. I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that. You had acknowledged that we have more money for this. It's not that we have more money, we can push up the price. Didn't you say so? That's what I mean. We can increase the cost. Yeah. Okay. So I don't know whether having I think the design and technology has to come back and say, okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume, because we do have a volume target of fifty million profit. Kay. I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it. So Right. Yeah. So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to, though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components. But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that, and what sorta price can we make it for? No I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting, our management is really looking for us to push our brand. We're entering a new market here, so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to But what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for? Okay I'm okay with that. I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal with the cost estimate attached, and then we have to take this to the next level. Let's try and think now, how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store, and you were in the market to replace your TV remote, how much would you pay for that? We have to find cost. But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market. I'm just asking you. I'm a student, but on the other hand mm with my Project Manager salary, I would think I could probably afford this would I buy it? If Then you could probably afford this. Maybe. If I had a cool new TV and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel, which I think's a really cool idea, that would sell me on it a little. Then maybe. I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly, that would be way too much, but I would be happy paying over forty for it, guess, but not much 'Kay. No no. I would say thirty five to forty. I was gonna say thirty five to fifty. Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay. Okay. So the question is what we we make it for. Because one of one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television. Right. Mm. It's one of the marketing features in this. That's why the scroll needs to be really robust. Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rubber, robust, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel favourite stuff, favourite channels, and with a cradle, and the locator. Mm-hmm. With a cradle, radio transmitters, and back-lit buttons. And it's gonna look sexy. Or not. Or not. It might look like clay. Okay so you can market depending on that? That's that's easy. That's that's not a, it's a. Cause we have about six, six, seven features in that alone. Yep. Under the title of uniquenesses. Cool. Hmm. Okay. The next meeting starts in thirty minutes, although does it? It starts at three twenty one, the next meeting. So we've got more than a thirty minutes. We've got more like fifty. I Is my three twenty one is the next meeting? The next meeting is three twenty one. That's almost fifty minutes. That is. They've changed the times from the presentations. You guys You guys can create All kinds of things. Probably. We'll let when we're done, if we can go earlier. Thanks. Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do, look like, how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail? Yeah. I don't think so. If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess. Okay. I think pretty much everything's covered. Okay. This one was quite easy. Coulda been worse. Still. Always the optimist. Yes I am. Kay thanks guys. Thank you. I don't have any emails. This means I can go home. We all leave.",
