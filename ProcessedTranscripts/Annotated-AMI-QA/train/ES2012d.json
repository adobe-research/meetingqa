    "displayText": "Right. Welcome to what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done a good job here and we'll just go through the final the final details. Okay, the the minutes of the last meeting I think we'll take those as read, Okay the the next thing we we'll have a look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and then we can close. So if you'd like to present your proposals. Okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the shape of your hand, basically. On the left we've got the scroll for the volume, on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll, or you can hold it and push. It's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on. Uh-huh. That's the little menu key. This is the infra-red section so it'll be sending rays and if you're pointing it like that it can send it, or if you hold it up like that it'll send it. Yep, good, good. We got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can talk to it like that and it'll still understand. Uh-huh. Yep, right. The logo is down down there and has the cover on it and you can see the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through. Uh-huh. Mm. And so we figured it would be kind of a light weight plastic, just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers, so they kinda just stretch over. Yep, yep, mm-hmm. Um. Mm. Uh-huh. Yep yep. Yep. Mm. Showing me age, I don't know what i iPod covers are like. I didn't know that but it's just kind of a rubbery and that way spongy is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and then each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the RR. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, yep, right. Mm-hmm. But it's also easier to put on versus mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you. Okay. This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine. Yep. Okay, good. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, right. That'll be the covers as well. Yeah. It's a detailed point, I just wondered how will people put these down I wonder? Like that. Right. Okay for some strange reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but no because particularly if they're gonna have it as a fashion item it's it it's just it's just a minor detailed point, but as say can just make the base a little bit bigger and and it just needs another logo somewhere is is is all it gives people the option and if say if they've got them because actually have several upon the. It could stand. Oh. We could broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that. Standing. We could just widen it out Mm. Mm. Could have one for your stereo, one for your DV player. Mm. Yeah. Have to if we just lengthen it guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there. Just kind of Or just make it little. That's but no the the overall the overall concept is no no, that's these. Mm. Somewhere like that so it just sort of. Yeah. Yeah. We might have to lengthen it so your hand still holds it and have it there, like that. I kinda had a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's more of a kind of a kinda maybe slightly thinner, kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda just click there. Yeah. But no but the the the it's wouldn't do that, indeed. Mm. Fall over. The final product would actually stand up. Yeah. But these were all minor minor details, I think the basic concept is absolutely bang on and it certainly meets our criteria of looking different. Yeah. Yeah. S a little longer. Wee Mm. Yeah. So good that that's excellent. Right let us What's on the next one? Right yes, let's have a look at the finance. Now we're given a clear design brief, if I get the spreadsheet up. Oh. The maximise button. Right. Ah. Good, this is why we need to make these things simple so that the the the boss can understand. Now this is the company's costing for various aspects of design and I I've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us, I wouldn't know for instance if they require us to have it in the corporate colours, then that is not a special colour, that's a standard colour. So we're just simply on batteries, the one the one decision I've had to make is that we will have to find a regular standard chip to do this with and I I'm I'm I'm certain that they are around that I don't think is a serious problem. The the voice sensor is expensive but we made a basic decision that was absolutely fundamental to the design so that that has to stay. Then again the the the shape of the case means that it's expensive to make 'cause of the the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we should exceed the sales targets. It's simply made of plastic so that's no problem and just because the colour of the whole thing there's some cost there. And we we got push buttons and a simple slider and the and the buttons are I don't know that they're special colour. Anyway the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five but I think we have a very strong case to argue that what we've got is so innovative and different that any slight compromise we have to make on cost is offset by the the the the concept of it being a fashion accessory and having the interchangeable covers so if if the management expect us to be again fail again technologically innovative that they they have to accept that we can't operate absolutely within the constraints that they give, so the company's uh the company's way forward and I think we can argue that we have come in on on budget. Mm. Mm. Um. Okay. So. Andrew do you want what do you want to say about the evaluation where where we're where we're at? Evaluation. The the product or the project? The the the I meant the product. My presentation just now? Yeah. Sure, can I get the Cheers. Sorry mm. Mm. More loud clicks in the microphone. There we go. Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve, from the point of view of the the consumer and the management. So what I've been asked to do is, on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions. So, on a scale of one to seven, one being true and seven being being false. Seven being a nice round number to work to. Yeah. And then at the end just take an average Yes. On for true and seven for flase. Yes. So. Look at these questions. Is the device flashy and fashionable? I think most definitely. I'd say definitely a one. I think it is. And also technologically innovative? Yes the voice technology indeed. Yeah. Easy to use? I don't see we could've made it any easier. Yeah. Suitable for the consumer? That was. Totally. Definitely. I think it made we met all of the consumer wants. Yeah. Is it complicated? No. No. Doing pretty well so far aren't we? Functional? Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Um. Where are we? Found easily. We've built in the the speech, where are you, function. That's. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh-huh. Does it take long to learn to use? Shouldn't. No, not at all. Mm-hmm. And what else? The RSI compares to the current standards. Less buttons so it must be. It is sorta the handle more ergonomically correct as well. It was our it was a we made an actual effort to will device appeal to all age groups? Yeah. So. Yeah. I think it will because older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably the voice bit so And it's it's I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway, in the end, so. Mm. I think so. That's a good call. Mm. We had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the increased functionality, the ease of use of the device might make up for that. Mm. I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people would be more conscious of that aspect of it, but I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It will appeal for different reasons but it's so I I so I think we can reasonably say it's another one, why not? I think just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having a million buttons. Yeah. Mm. Can you just click my mouse to move onto next page? And what did we make the management's. In in in my interpretation of management's instructions is that yes it meets the requirement is it's television only, it's simple to use, it's it's within budget, it's yes any minor points we we argue. Yep. Mm-hmm. Under the cost. Mm-hmm. Yep. So I think we've done an amazing job in coming up with what Need a calculator for that. Yep. Okay. Done us. So one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven. Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one. Yeah. And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product. Excellent. Okay, nick the cable back then. I mixed up the colours a little bit. No that's. I think I all wrong. Ooh. Right do either of you want to say anything? Mm. Mm. No. I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's right, this slide here the satisfaction with room for creativity, I think we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the the the product allows. Mm. Definitely. I won't comment on leadership, teamwork I think everybody's worked pretty well together. Mm-hmm. We've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens, I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found, again no given relatively everyday product, I think we've very effectively come up with a new a new approach. Mm. Yeah. Yep. Are the costs within budget? Yes. Is the project evaluated? We're all happy that it meets all the criteria, Thank you very much indeed, I think that's I think we can go for an early bath. Yep. Alright. Yeah. So I call the meeting closed. Okay. Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there.",
