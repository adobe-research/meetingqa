    "displayText": "Okay. So I see all everybody's here, 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yep. And we can start meeting. Okay. What's the agenda for this meeting? I will present here agenda with with with slides to you. Okay. As you can see here. Perfect. So first just to mention I will take notes of this meeting and I will try to work them out and give them to you. Mm-hmm. I've also made notes of the previous meeting and I was about to send them you but then I had to go to this meeting so you will get them too. Mm-hmm. Next. You are the secretary also. Yes. Right? Okay. Indeed. Um. Then I hope you all have worked out some some some presentations about the task given to you in the previous meeting. Perfectly of course uh-huh. Um. In a minute we will start with them. We will see in which order we will handle them of. Then I will bring in some some new requirements I got from the account manager, I try to work them out, they were quite abstract, and we can maybe have some discussion about it. Mm-hmm. About the functions and in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the Yes yes who are we going to to sell the customers, indeed yes. Mm. You mean the social target group who we wants to target? Mm. The customers, okay. Yeah. Think that's that's important matter. That's the big question. Uh. And then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll have a lunch. Good. Um. Maybe why Anna do you have a presentations? No, I don't. You don't have presentation? I wasn't. No. You want a table to Yes yes maybe you can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary. I I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything. Mm-hmm. I've just been presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so, a hundred people, just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control. Um. It's probably can't email this to you, I've just got a web page with some data on it. Basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. Seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Mm-hmm. Um. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot, so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television. Uh. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons, so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that. Mm. Um. Do you have this information on the web page you said? I have a web page yes. Yes, maybe you can send an email to me later. Yep. Yep, sure. About this. Mm-hmm. So basically there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a remote control. Power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour. Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like audio settings, which are only used very infrequently. Mm. Um. Teletext is used fourteen times in the hour, so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used. Mm. Um. An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room, so some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users. Yes yes, I have that too. Um. Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control, they want something that's easier to use straight away, more intuitive perhaps. Mm. Um. It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's Okay too much time to learn. Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one. Yep. Okay. Um. Not enough Maybe you cannot put this webpage online on the Ah it's okay it's a webpage on the C it's a file okay. And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for RSI. I don't know how we'd go about combating that. What do you mean there? For RSI? Repetitive strain injury. Okay. Mm. So. But Mm. They think that or do their doctor the doctor says? But it's the opinion of the users? Yeah. That's what the report says. So mm. And then it's got a demographic breakdown on I should be able to actually, if I email it to you now. You can disconnect it there no? You can maybe just. No. Yeah. Otherwise you. Hang on. Then you can connect this one or this one. You can connect this one. All to your computer. Yeah. Well. So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional these numbers have to be have to be taken into account for the both user interface and functional design. I need to muck around with this. It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you. It's just a web link. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. One thing it goes on to talk about, which is interesting, is the hang on a minute. Because if there are many numbers and we need constraint our design based on what is more important. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. One thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in a remote control. Speech recognition in Ah okay. And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful. Do you have numbers on that? Yes, I'll just get this up. So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech. Potentially even for I think that would not work so well. Okay. Interesting idea. You wanna have both options. Okay. It would be a solution for when your remote control is lost, when it has speech recognition then it doesn't matter where it is, my we should be in range, or maybe it can respond and produce sound, so say where it is. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. But these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro and fifty cents. It would be No you can't. Yeah. Yeah. And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is, maybe? Oh. It depends it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on, off, one, two, twenty three. Mm. But it's quite noisy if there is the TV shouting. Mm. Yeah. It's going to be it's not going to be so easy but usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but don't with twenty Okay it's decline. Yes, that that that's mm. Do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation? Okay. This is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control, who would pay more for it. So you had to to summarise maybe the Mm. Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more, it goes down from there, seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five, thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five, twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product, which we'll be talking about later I think. Decline with age, mm. Mm. Yes. We will talk about it later. Did you get the email? Okay. Yep, that one. Mm-hmm. Just follow that link. You. It'll be in a different window, yep. That's left that one. Yep. Okay perfect. Mm. So that's the figure that I was just talking about there, with the different demographics. Okay. Another thing it's talking about there is the LCD screen but there's no figures apparently on that. Mm. Mm 'kay. Okay. Maybe Mael can you give your presentation? Yeah. Mm okay I stay I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair? Mm-hmm, you can move. Now you can move I think. I okay. Yes. You can you can take my chair. It's a channel selection, a module, this and this function, go to the. Sorry? Oh. Yeah. So I think as everybody knows I'm the Industrial Designer. And in this group presentation is gonna focus on the working design of the remote control. I'd like first to give a very simple introduction, how does it work, so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very technical background what is it because I think in the product it is important. Mm. So basically the basic function of a remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed. Mm-hmm. And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually through a infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages, alright. Mm-hmm. So my method for designing the work design first the main point is that I would wish to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work. Mm. Mm-hmm. So for that as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing Expert Anna and to we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control and I show you the working design. Mm-hmm. So basically here is a really large view of what we want. We want an on off button, it's simple but it's important, and also to both channels as well as other buttons that come after, right. Mm. So the components I quickly draw here, is that in this part you have the remote control the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method will be to my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So of course we need energy sources and the receiver a receiver. This is very quick design, you stop me or interrupt me if you don't agree on it on that. Mm-hmm. So what I have found and after a lot of work actually I draw this I draw for you this schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me. Well. Uh-huh. You drew it a long time ago? Is overwhelming. And that's it so I won't go into details about that but these are my preferences to use that kind of components. Ninety one. No. And and why do you want these kind of component? So. Are they cheap, or are they reliable? What were your Mm. So the main components see here are the cheapest I have found and you have always a compromise with reliability and if it's expensive, but this one was not this one also really reliable so that's it for the working design, I hope you get clearer view on what a remote control is in terms of technical components but maybe No no no no we will This is a preference but we can always change. Yes. It it it's more clear now I think. So Mm-hmm. But can you just buy it on the market and plug it in or you want to it's just you had to change the frequencies. What I was thinking about the the schema about the sender and the receiver, can you get back to it? The receiver is of course already in the television and we are not able to change it. Of course. So we we must adapt to the to the receiver. I suppose there is a standard way of communicating to televisions. Yeah. We will use infrared protocol using infrared and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists but what we can do is adapting the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Okay. Um. Okay. Thank you. The frequencies? Yeah. Of course in the chip you have it. But you should be careful, people are sometime becoming problem, like a guy has recently designed a remote which could switch off any other TVs, so basically through all the things. That can control other things. Yeah. Mm. Ah. So maybe we should think of. Of course we should take that into account in the Yes. Yes I I I I feel I I think Mael will consider these things. That's handy. So if the TV in the next apartment's really loud, you can just turn it off. So you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's TV and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the TV at all. Yeah. I like that idea. Maybe we can go to your presentation Matthew. So. I I I assume you were finished here. Okay. Okay. So I can take mine now there. Okay. Okay so voila. I can take mine it's okay, voila, mm so mm. Okay. Oh. I sorry? I know where it is. It's on the desktop. It's Yes. Technical function. Okay. It's Mm-hmm. So. Well. So I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so actually it's about what is the user going to do, I think my last presented what is going inside, so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it. Mm-hmm. Yep. So the approach is that basically the idea is to send a message to the TV set, as Mael has pointed, and it will be decoded by the TV and usually it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then changing a button will basically change the message which is being sent to the TV and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver. Mm-hmm. So as Anna has said that this people are interested in things which are you don't need to press the keys, people can have a speech recognition but this is a question which will we have to see later. But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone, and it sends a message to the TV. Mm. Yep. So generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but so there are two kinds of remote popularly in the household, actually so you have a standard TV remote where you have just a on, off button and play, volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example right now more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is ninety nine, but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows, but. Then this is the standard one without any fancy thing it doesn't have teletext option, it without any, it's a very simple thing, which you can vouch. And then you have what's the video remote file usually it has almost all the keys over there but then it has other options like stop and then you play the movie or fast forward the movie or something like that so it has those so these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the market. Mm-hmm. And then which is generally used by the people. And then personal preferences I would basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where we could have both the a TV and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video's remote control and the TV they could be integrated together so that we could aim in the coming future that type of applications with. Okay. How would that work? So you've got say maybe a VCR and a TV which are separate, so on my one at home I've got a VCR remote which then changes the channel on the VCR and doesn't do anything on the TV, so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says use the TV or use the VCR? Yeah. Or does it know which one you want to use? Actually you could think of having a you can have a key which could tell it could go to the video thing but you you still can't in that case when you use that the function should be able to take up the VCR option and you could play it or You can also think about having in a few days you will be in few coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box and you have something like you you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and you can just when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch a program. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. In that case you want to browse faster, browse slow, you want to have those kind of functionalities. Mm. Mm mm mm mm mm. Mm. These are kind of next generation functionalities. It's the next generation thing, but it is going to come in couple of years. Mm yes, but I think it's already there, the hard disk recorders I've seen them in the shop. Mm. It's. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm 'kay. So it's going to record your things and you need basically the functionalities what you need in both video as well as in the standard TV thing. Mm. Yeah. That's fair enough. Mm. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. No no we are not making a universal remote, we are just looking at giving a scenario, I have a TV and tomorrow I am going to set up box which is going to sit there and it's going to do that job for me. That's. Mm. Mm. Because Mm-hmm. We need to decide on on on in how far we go to in this. Mean, you can go pretty far I think with with functions and possible future prospects yes. Mm. Mm. Yep. Yeah. Okay so that ends my presentation. But it's good to keep in mind. Mm. Mm. Very well. Well. So we can always discuss about it for example presently the video market actually this demand, video over-demand or what we call it as, it's presently booming up actually so people are providing things like movies, you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and your provider gives a list of movies, and then you select those list. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And it basically you go off, it downloads the movie, it gives for you and then when you come you want to watch it on your TV. Yeah. Mm. And this is going to come. Good. Or even you don't need to download it, it's streamed online. It can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie so. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So I have received some some some points of thinking over of my account manager and I would like to share them with you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. First thing is teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's getting used less and less. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's that's especially because of the internet of course. Hmm. So we should think about it. Do we include it, and do we give it a prominent place on on the on on the remote control itself. Mm. In any case it's not used, very much, but it is still used. Mm. Um. Further yes we must think, do we stay to television only, the television as we all know it with broadcasting signals and you can't go back or do we go further as Matthew indicated by supporting recording devices? Indeed indeed. So DVDs and VCRs? Mm. And and and the hard disk recorders. Furthermore, we really need to interest younger customers and then with younger customers people below the age of forty, and our current customers are mainly forty plus which Forty. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Fourteen or okay. So Mm-hmm. So that's there's a market but they will grow older and you'll always need to have the future with younger people. Mm-hmm. Therefore, younger people like trendy trendy designs, so we should make our our RC as trendy as possible but it should also have a reliable image, so when it looks too spacey or too fancy people will think does it work at all. Hmm. Mm. You can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys, right now if you take it you have zero, one, two, three a keys separately, but suppose if you take the present trend of mobile phones there are big thick keys you press on the top, it takes one number, you press on the bottom it is uh Yeah so. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Maybe you can draw it on the board. Mm. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we're going after a younger market, that's the the mm the new and the funky things, there's lots of pretty mobile phones, not too many pretty remote controls. Yeah. Yes yes Yes it's recognisable Mm mm. Because they are already used to that, product. Yeah. That's Mm. And they are skilled by using it. So for example Okay, it works. Mm-hmm. Fine. So, for example you have presently keys like one, two, three like this, actually, and four five six like that and you can have keys like this in form keys like that Forty minutes? Mael can you hand me over this? Yes. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Okay. How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way? Mm I think five Mm-hmm. Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue. So you you can have keys which are so. Too sorry, so we basically don't change the original order of them but then the keys are more spacious, they don't look so there is a very thing, so if you press on the top it takes the three, four, sorry four here five and six, so it looks not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options if you press on the. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Kay I I think now that the idea's clear. Yep. Mm. We should now try to decide on our target group. Yeah. Which I think is quite tricky. Yeah. Basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one? Of course they have already one. So our our our remote control has to be better. But it's not going to have more functionality, 'cause it's only a low market, it's a cheap-end remote control, we can't beat modern functionality, we might we'll be able to beat them on the look of it, the design of it but that's not a big seller, if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty, they have to actually need it as well. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing. Mm. I think many people said in your research the appearance of the RC is important when they are buying one but Indeed. Mm. Yeah. But why are they buying one in the first place? So that will be about functionality Mm. Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote, otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things. Mm-hmm. Mm. In that case they wouldn't buy our product, because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality. So your you think we should go for a more universal high-performance What do What do you think about What I don't know. We can't, with the price range. We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product. We have twelve point five Euros per R RC I think with this now that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new new features. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. But I don't think LCD is not necessary for long term. But. If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to LCD screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot. I don't know whether that's necessary. Is the LCD screen I think this could be a market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive. For universal remotes If you mm. And quite complicated to use, yes. So we can try to go in between, and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal RC because it is in some kind universal. Mm-hmm. Not as flexible maybe, but. Yeah. Universal. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own TVs to use a remote control on. Mm yes but we're targeting more on the twenty to forty group. Okay. So they're. People yes. Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is. Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range, or are we kind of middle to bottom? I don't know. When we think it over I think we are trying to offer a kind of universal control for less money. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Do you agree? It's fine with me the price as long as it is not too expensive. Because we have to take into account that we are gonna sell around four million so when we speak about these numbers price of a chip is very cheap. And Our Mm. Mm. So I'm okay for designing less a kind of universal RC. Mm-hmm. You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty? Yeah. Okay. So then we decide on on going to this more universal kind of control. That's what we needed basically. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Okay. That's needed right now. And basically you can look to the standards of other. That's needed. Mm. And if we want to get the market, we really need that. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices, being able to switch between them, there may be stereo, VCR and TV. Yes. Exactly. And just be able to use them all from the same remote, but not at the same time. Yes. You can also browse through all the standards where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them. Is that okay for you? Yeah. Mm mm mm mm. Yeah. Yeah. So given we are going for this universal type maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and you will try to get more specific user interface content and maybe you can look on what trends are in this type of market. Yes. Mm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm yep. Voila. Hmm. So anyone has a point to bring in or shall we no. So. Well. I don't have anything right now. We'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the so we meet in what are our Okay. That's fine then. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yes, we can have lunch now. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So Then after lunch we have thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer. Okay. Cool. Okay perfect. So see you later.",
