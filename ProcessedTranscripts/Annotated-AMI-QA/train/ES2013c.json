    "displayText": "Hi Kate. Just just carry on. Okay, carry on. Alright this is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting. Our agenda should be that the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point. And we should each have a presentation to make. We have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total. It's twenty five after two at the moment, so forty minutes is five after three, which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us. Okay. There are the decisions we have to turn to, but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting. Right as we remember, the four of us were present, the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved. Sarah, you presented a marketing research report which pretty much represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand-held, power, channel, volume, number keys, possibly a speech recognition. And then Steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use. I think all of us agreed with those things. Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass-produced device, because of the twelve and a half Pence cost. But we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. And the new requirements that it be for TV only and that it include the slogan and colour of the corporate design be included. The corporate image. So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense, that were decision makers. Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the TV, but it still should meet those parameters. And that the function we agreed was volume, power, numbers, enter, channels, a way to move between channels, easy to use and hand-held. At that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition, what do the current ones sell for. And Steph was gonna look at ergonomics. Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed. And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report. Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was? Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. So we're ready to close that and go back to our That one. Right. We're up to the point of the Go back. The three presentations. So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah. Is that okay? Is that alright with everybody else? Yep. Mm-hmm. Especially since Kate asked to be last. I respond to either. No worries. You respond to whatever you get? Okay. Did you do your Hit Ah, there it is. Right. Ta-da. Okay, first thing I want to address is one of the points that Florence brought up, which was current cost of the competition devices, similar to the ones that Stephanie showed us and they're twenty to sixty Euros, depending on branding. Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end. But I think that with the current price that we're searching for, we're even on the lower end, of the market. Mm 'kay. But I'm going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things. So, I investigated the remote control market in greater detail, and the theme of what I was to work on was trend watch. And I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research, so I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here. Kay. Sorry. I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on. What's hot, fruit and veg. Spongy. And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, and I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes. This is really interesting change from past years, because it is much more organic, some would say approachable. Mm. And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control, we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. So. I also did a little research on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing. Fancy. Functional is out. And that's exactly the term, I'm thinking polished, elegant, kind of innovative, but a cut above. This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative. This is interesting, 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important, but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with technologically superior fabrics or designed in interesting substances. Ease of use. Again, pretty low, it's the top three, but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important. So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves. I think that's a good idea. Don't you? Exactly. Yes. It sounds like the covers that they use for your cell phone. Exactly. I was thinking though that instead of having something patterned, so, something similar to a summer dress. It would have fruit and veg, is that we actually make these spongy. Mm. Initially I thought we could start with kind of fruit that would suit kind of a long hand-held, so banana, pineapple and pear. The sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control, we'd just need to get reductionist on it. They could be interchangeable, they're spongy, that goes back to ergonomic, and the youngsters love 'em, fun for the whole family, everyone can have their own. So what we're talking about is changing. This concept. Everyone has a TV remote, but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit. That's what's hot on the catwalks. So, this is my This is what I'm thinking. Hmm. Uh-huh mm. In most families, don't isn't the remote is a remote. But I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote, but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising, I'm thinking the teenager, someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers. Mm. So when your dad's sitting there, overriding your decision, going no you can bring out your own remote and be zap, no we're gonna watch this. Yeah. And plus I think. Mm. Actually some households do have three and four TVs and they would have a remote for each one, so. Yeah. Yeah. So this is an idea and I this is exactly what the research has shown. So I really open this up to any other feedback. This spongy fruit and veg. I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this. Thanks. Alright. Yep. Spongy is gonna be difficult, I'm afraid. Hmm. Hmm. And as for budgeting as well, if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components. I I just have my ear to the market, guys. Is this to the market? Basically we can make these things out of wood, titanium, plastic or rubber. I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy. Is spongiest. That would add Mm-hmm. I was thinking titanium myself. I was thinking titanium, I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, and they're also minimalist and shiny. And they would fulfil the first priority, which is fancy. I think many of us would associate those with fancy. Something else we could do is call it something that's fruit and veg oriented. We could call it The name. Are we talking about the device itself or the or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cover as a separate product? It would be a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable. Perhaps perhaps that that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product. So That, might be And then we could keep it titanium. But it's kind of pointless, isn't it? Yeah. Let's delegate. Would that be agreeable? Yeah. Would it be helpful if I described the components a bit, because I think it would maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do. Maybe. Or I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next. Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next? Okay, we'll move the Mm. You can even have them in different flavours as well. So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote, it could be pear flavour. Yeah. Or or smelly. Scratchy I was really thinking a lot about I the iMac kind of gel gem tone. Scratch and sniff. It's hot on the streets, guys. Right, I I think some of this you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you, but I'm afraid this is the real world. So I've been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate, and I've had some discussions with the manufacturing division, who have told me what's actually available, what the current state of the art in components is, and some of the exciting new things they've got, but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want. Now this isn't a very good overhead, but this is the innards of a remote control. I really need a pen or something but does my mouse work? No. Can you see my little mouse pointer? Right. This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface. Mm. And this is a push-button one, so you see these little little buttons here, they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here. And that's the basic construction that we've got to accommodate. We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the message to the receiver. So I wanna go through not just addressing the the points that you made, Sarah, but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it. So first of all I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source. We can have your bog standard double double A batteries in a replaceable little compartment. We can have a hand sorry a wind-up, which I think is quite an interesting concept for a remote control, but it maybe doesn't quite go with the fruit and veg. A wind-up. One that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source, where you actually get the energy by moving the device, which is quite a nice and neat one. Alright. Remember, we only have forty minutes. Mm. You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work, but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then, it'll work. Hmm. Or we we had talked about solar power, but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark. Mm. Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on the case. It can be made of plastic, rubber, wood if you like, or titanium. Hmm. And the nearest we've got to spongy there guess is rubber, but I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium, and basically it can have a curved surface or a double curved surface, but I think if we wanna use standard components, we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, what does the interface look like? Push button, that's the one we're all familiar with. We can have scroll buttons and the scroll button can incorporate a push, so you can have it on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down, change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something. Hmm. You can have multiple scroll buttons, this is maybe getting a little bit complicated, but it the technology is there. And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote, but this will increase the cost. The electronics that actually makes the device work, we've basically got three, simple, regular, advanced, and the price goes up as we choose each of this. If we want the nice cheap one, the simple, then we can only have push buttons. All the other fancy interface designs go out the window, I'm afraid. Pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons. If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more, but it that's what you need if you want the LCD display. And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample speaker devices. Now I don't know what that is, but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere. Our real expertise is in push buttons, have to say, but maybe you think that's old technology. Mm. And I think we've got two options. We can either go for a really cheap model, keep all of the costs down, which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons. Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer, I think it, won't necessarily look like a pineapple, but that may or may not be a good thing. Sorry. But it could have an LCD screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons, and it could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker. So, thank you. That sounds good. Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference. Do you have any idea if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty? I'm afraid I don't have that information available. Manufacturing didn't actually attach any prices to any of this, I'm afraid. Hmm. Hmm. Because, you know what, I'm being quite serious when I say that the things I mentioned are hot. But I think the important thing might be to choose one. If what you're telling me is some of these things just aren't feasible, maybe we could something about naming, we could call it, Blackberry. Mm-hmm. That's Alright, let's see then. Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company, so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it. Banana? But I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company. Yeah. It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing. Yeah. That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future, fruit-wise. But I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit. We could we could do a double curved rubber one, which would allow say a banana, but unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that, we have to have a push button as the interface, we can't do anything fancier. Yeah. Hmm. Shall we wait 'til I've showed you my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available. Yeah. Mm. Yep. Thank you, Kate. Thank you, Kate. Mm. You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though. So so mine's a bit pointless. Right. FN and F eight, did you say? Yes. There we go. I don't have it on mine though. I think Florence resolved it by F eight again. If you do FN F eight again, it'll I think you you will do an. Do it again. Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there, you get it yours without that one, and then you get it with both. Should I do it again? Maybe. Yeah. This time it should come up both. Right then. I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says, just that my method was to look at my inspirations, which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing, including MP three players, hi-fi remotes, not just television and these things. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Having a think about the feature of the features of each ones, what functions we actually need, and then how to group and arrange these on the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece. I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel, which I couldn't find the picture of the iPod only linked to a web browser, so I couldn't copy and paste it, but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right. It has scroll wheels without a display, but they scroll like a computer mouse. Hmm. So I was thinking that a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen. I guess an existing Sky or cable one does. You enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment, and you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour, and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen. But I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote, which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice, big, easy buttons to press, but still quite simple and quite cost effective. Mm. So what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple, not fancy but not totally minimalist, just pretty simple plastic, probably, I was thinking, yellow and black, just because that's the company's colours, with very very few buttons, but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen, just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes, which is far too expensive. Hmm. And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you, you might as well have it appearing on the screen in front of you, it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching. Mm. Yeah. And so on that you can, just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote, scroll along, scroll up and down. I'd certainly support that idea. And I definitely support the use of plastic or rubber. Titanium would be great, but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey. If we're trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic, then I think titanium's too futuristic. It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well, we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately. Yeah. Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else. Hmm. Then And it's a little bit pointless as well I think. And the having the the screen on the television screen is a good idea, 'cause otherwise we're putting up the price not only for building the LCD in, but for the electronics as well. It's a duplication. When when you've got when you've got the screen there, it doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a little menu showing a menu, you go into one menu and then it can have your different options, whether you wanna change the settings or your information about programme that's on at the moment. There is that. Mm-hmm. I don't think that's to taxing to engineer. Um. But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one. And I quite like it, 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out, so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle. Mm-hmm. Up, down, left, right. Do you want scroll buttons in that as well? I was thinking not actually scroll, a mouse scroll, but a I can't quite describe it. See one right, down at the bottom, is the mouse. See where the mouse is, this style thing where you have up, down, left and right. Mm-hmm. Right. And enter in the middle, so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one, it you can go into a new menu for that. I'm getting a bit specific here. Really we'd have to use something to show you, but If I don't think I can get it up on the screen. Yeah. I think I think that's a nice clean design, it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology. To make it. Ah here we go. Right. Nice. The iPod spinning wheel is really complicated. Huh. It does scroll, but it is hugely complicated. Yeah. Mm. What else have we got? Wow. Them, they're terrible. But they all have this feature of this It's not quite a scroll wheel, but it's a kind of selection in this circle, which I think is a really good idea. It's a selection wheel. But we can implement it with simple push buttons, which is much cheaper. Up, down, left and right. Which is good. And then so either a channel up and down, volume up and down, next appearing programmes up and down, and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen, it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down. Okay. So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle. Okay. And that's it. In fact that's really nice. Look at look at this one. Almost impossible to misplace or or lose. Do you think It seems that you guys are quite keen on the plastic, perhaps something reminiscent of the child's remote. Might take up your whole living room. Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour? And have it abstract. We could call a fruit name, but it would be a little more abstract. Possibly. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. That also is possible. We could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy. Mm-hmm. I'm just just throwing out ideas. Just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you seen these on a remote? Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow. Yeah. I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. This is actually the volume up and down, but they both say V on them, which, when you first look at it, you expect that to be the down, because it looks like a downward pointing arrow, but it's actually the V to indicate that it's the volume, so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Nice. Good point. But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down. If we're having the scroll wheel, then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions. Mm 'kay. But then, that's complicated. I wanna thank you all for all your presentations. We have about ten minutes left, in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts. And I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together. We need to come up with some specifics of the components, the materials, things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things. So let's Mm. Right. They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use, which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic or solar. This is where Kate's expertise comes in, and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point. You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries. Or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day, that it'll die on you, and no way to do it. That's the day you wanna use the TV. Mm. So what's our pleasure here, what would be the cost consequences of each of the three? Unfortunately I don't have costing information. Okay. In terms of workability, I think the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic. Mm 'kay. What's the feelings of the group on the kinetic? I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very handy, you don't even notice that it's there. It sounds great. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic. Sounds like it could be a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient. It's Mm-hmm. Hmm. It could tie in with the fanciful design as throw the banana, just gotta keep it moving. Hmm. Yeah. Cause it's really a quite attractive thought, isn't it? It's a good selling point. So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible. Yeah. But it does depend how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs. It costs. Mm. And and how much you do have to keep it moving, 'cause I'm conscious that watching TV can be quite a sedentary activity. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But I could market that as a I was thinking actually a cost saver down the road, in terms of battery. Mm. Do your exercises while you're watching the TV. Yeah. Hmm. True, more environmentally friendly. That's what I was thinking as well. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Kind of That's exactly what I was thinking. Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish, thanks. The next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision. Right, okay, that that's something I maybe should have covered. Chip on print is just a manufacturing technique and I would certainly recommend it, because I'm not sure I have an alternative. Oh. Okay. It's just the the the way it's actually built and you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper. What about the. The way we uh-huh. Okay. What about the case? I think they're talking there about do we want wood, plastic, titanium or rubber, and I think we've discussed not having titanium. One, it's too expensive, and second, it won't do this double curves. We've sort of eliminated wood. We said plastic or rubber. What's the pleasure? If Sarah's keen on a spongy feel, the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls, so it's. I'm sold. What about you? Do you not think it might need a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy thick spongy cover, so it feels like the whole thing's spongy, but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it. Mm. Kind of like an internal egg. Cover. Uh-huh. Plastic inside. Yeah. Because you could just get carried away with the. Yeah. I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible, but I agree, it's sounds like a nice idea if it is. You do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile, you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them, and Just copy the one on the left. Hmm. And with sports on television. Okay. You know. The next part they want is the user interface concept. I Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that. I should Which I think technically is just push button and I'd certainly support that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that the company's an expert on. I'm sorry to push you, but we only have a couple minutes to finish with. Okay, and it says interface. What type and what supplements? No a scroll four buttons, up, down, left and right with enter in the middle, that will correspond to a menu on the screen. I'd push buttons with So push buttons No, it's still plugged in on mine actually. Okay, that. This is gonna sound weird, but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes. Whew. And they actually want a look and feel design, user interface design, you can look and see this as well as I can. Marketing they want product evaluation. No we can't, actually. Oh. My, I'm sorry. That's why I was looking over your shoulder Mm. Okay. Sorry about that. Missed that one. This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work. Ah, ta-da. Now it's gone again. Ah. I think the company's next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately. Yes, because I can't even see mine. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes, these are the individual actions. Yes. Right. The look and feel design is for Kate, Steph gets the user interface design, you get product evaluation. The two of you get to play with a modelling clay to do a prototype. Great. And everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way. Sounds good. Anything else we need to do? I don't think so. Go to it. Play-Doh. And that's the end of this meeting. That's for her benefit. That's really all I got, guys.",
