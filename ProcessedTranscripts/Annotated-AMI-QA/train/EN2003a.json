    "displayText": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can you just remind me, I don't have to tick the no okay thing until I finish writing, but it's only if I go back to it I tick okay again. Yeah. Mm. Yep. So if you're back to a page, then you tick it again to leave it for the second time. So if I'm working if I've done a. Mm-hmm. So it's always after, you never have to it before. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Okay. I don't believe all this stuff. It's just amazing. And you can go on both sides as well. Okay. Right. Where should we start? I think the first thing is the first thing I think is we need to sort out the call for abstracts or the call for titles, because I think that's kind of overdue. What have we got? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah? So I volunteer to do that if you like. Okay. Fine. Right. Yep. And I'll do that by Trying to think, what is it Thursday today, I'll do that by the end of the week anyway. So we're gonna do that, but I think we should probably send out separate calls, okay. And was it your idea to stick the bit in it where you say we're inviting from quite a wide audience we give priority to linguists? Mm-hmm. So we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people, but I think it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there. We can mention it, but it's not gonna be too essential and we might actually just end up making them worry that, they're gonna lose their place or whatever, because I don't know. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I separate course is good idea. That's Mm-hmm. But we do have to decide a priority thing, so that's something else we can look at a little bit later down the line. So so that's the one for ling basically and I'll send that out. I'll do that today or tomorrow. Now Claire, that's the other thing, she can deal with the Psychology. Psychology people, probably I reckon it's the best thing to do. Cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So if one of us could email Claire. Mm. Was that a volunteering or great. Okay, so if Robert emails Claire and we're gonna need to decide exactly what she's gonna say on there. Yeah. When in doubt. We might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know, so she gets the dates right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I know she already knows that it's just anyone doing psycho-linguistics basically. Mm-hmm. So that's fine. And that should kinda take care of itself as well. If she just sends one round around to everyone, then only the psycho-linguists will say what was for me. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. But then there's the rest of PPLS and I think we need to decide whether I think she should just write her own. Right. But the text for the actual call, is she going to re-work something or she should Mm-hmm. Probably. And Okay. I think she might be glad to see kinda there linguistics to adapt. So what we'll do the thing is the main call will go out before she's got round to it anyway. That's always quite helpful. Mm-hmm. So what I'll do is I'll copy it. Yep. I'll CC her on the No, they won't be. Mm. cause I can't imagine there'd be an essential difference really between the Right. The only thing I'm thinking is I want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them, that they don't go we're just getting rubbish from what I mean. Yeah. Yeah. I want them to really know that it's addressed to them. And the good thing about Claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well and it might look a bit more relevant to them. Not certain anyway. Mm-hmm. They know her. Exactly. That's that thing. They know her, et cetera. So if we've if I've CCed the original one, then you can tell her that that can be the basis for her email, but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them, et cetera. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And obviously in PPLS we've also got English language. Now in a way we could send out that first call to them, just as part of the same email, because I think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them. I don't really know. I don't really know what you think about that. Mm-hmm. But I think we definitely should open it up to English language. I think particularly at the moment, 'cause they're really trying to sort of merge us into one subject area, even though it should be meaningless, because we're all part of a school, I think that it does actually make a difference. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And so I think we should invite them, but then we've still got the problem of a priority issue. So, probably what I was thinking is certainly second and third-years absolutely need to be on top priority. Mm-hmm. But then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first-years, because they don't need to. If they want to, should they have priority? Mm. This is a kind of lower point but it crosses over with deciding what we're gonna do when we. Do we have an idea of how many people were gonna actually have at the whole thing? Any kind of because then it because seems to me it could be quite obvious. I don't think so. Then we just subtract the number of second and third year students and then everything else is just I'd I would favour doing it just on a first come first serve basis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's send out the call as soon as possible, see what reactions we get. And then See if we have to put on some restraints. Okay. But if we're so, mean, we were gonna do this thing for can't even remember, was it two or three days? It's three days. Okay. And so how many how many posters and talks are we gonna actually gonna get in? Right. They were twenty minute talks with ten minute question time, okay. Let's see. Mm-hmm. Mm. And you can run two in a row, but probably not up to three. Up to three, but don't exaggerate. Two what do you think, two in a row or three in a row? If you do two in a row then that's an hour, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then give it a twenty minute break perhaps. Or Would we get that many people wanting to give talks? Yeah. Mm. The thing is every time we have a break, there's a question of whether we actually serve coffee and biscuits and things, because that's the kinda normal thing to do. Yeah. If we go for say I'm thinking slots of one and a half hour each. So three lectures each, that would be three per day times three will be twenty seven. Are you have, say, three sessions in a row and then do that twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon? Mm-hmm. So that'd be six hours. Once in the morning, twice in the afternoon. So just have an hour and a half in the morning. Yeah. Or twice in the morning once in the afternoon. Cause would six hours a day be pushing it? Not necessarily, because I suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say right, what's the maximum we can do? Mm-hmm. So I think that's about as much as we could do, to have an hour and a half, then have a coffee break, then have an hour and a half, then have lunch, hour and a half, coffee break, hour and a half. And so that would be eighteen hours of talks overall, wouldn't it? But what do we say? Mm-hmm. So it's so it's twelve thirty six talks, is that right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Maximum thirty six. Okay, let's just put this down. How many second and third year students are there? I could look 'cause I've got that the list, isn't there, of post-graduates I maintain in linguistics. There are probably about thirty on there. Right, okay. But a good number of them are first-years, and don't just to get an idea, are you planning on talking? No. No. Are you planning, Robert? No. And I'm probably not. So there's a good chance that almost none of the first-years are gonna volunteer. Mm-hmm. So if we had say twenty linguistics and even then, there are quite a few people who are abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever. So, it might be that we only get say fifteen anyway, and then we could be left with fifteen blocks for the rest of PPLS. So at least we know that we've got an absolute limit of about thirty-six talks? Mm-hmm. Yeah. We're also gonna be having posters, aren't we. And I should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a talk. Okay. Mm-hmm. And that's what the coffee breaks will be for, and maybe lunchtimes. But coffee breaks are probably more like or are gonna be a better time, because people will hang around, whereas people are more likely to go off somewhere for lunch, aren't they? But wouldn't we want to actually just dedicate an afternoon or a morning to being a poster session? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's what I was about to say, poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it. Mm. Actually there's always the problem again then the people who are presenting the posters don't get around to go and look at others' posters. But let's see about that. But people kinda generally sort of sort them out that sort that out themselves. Mm-hmm. Mm. It's the thing about posters, unless you kind of say, if your name is in the first half of the alphabet you can move and the other ones can't. Mm-hmm. Yeah. How long should a poster session be? How long will people want to mill around for looking at Okay. I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon. Just because ones that I've been to as well, people tend to kinda come and go from them. I I'd say either a whole morning or a whole afternoon at least. Mm-hmm. But that's just based on the ones that I've been to. So that means we could have thirty talks. Plus one AM or PM of posters. Yeah? Mm-hmm. And we could probably get quite a few in there, at least six anyway. At least six. At least six posters, if you see what I mean. Right. Okay. During the session, how many can you have going on at once? That's just kind of dictated by the size of the room really, isn't it? Wall space and First years. Yeah. Would we have poster boards or is it just gonna be posters on the walls? They did it like I should have found this out. Do we have any information on this? Are you guys second years or first years? You're both first year. First years. So so none of us have been to this before. No. Right. I've been to Durham post-graduate conference and every conference I've ever been to, the posters have always been in the coffee break, which is probably, because normally they're limited on space and they. Mm-hmm. Oh. Actually, we have a message here from Mits about the poster session. Poster session was introduced in nineteen ninety nine as part of the main conference. In two thousand it was held separately in October. The intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post-grad students to the department's research culture. However, I did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments I received from students in two thousand were generally discouraging. On the other hand, I later learned that some students did find the October poster session quite a useful experience. My suggestion therefore is to re-examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it. I think keeping it along-side the conference is possibly one way of maintaining interest and I think that's definitely the best idea. Mm. Yeah. Last sentence. One possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster. I think so. Mm-hmm. I can imagine it would seem a bit random just have a poster session and just have a poster session What would it be at the beginning? Mm-hmm. So I suppose it normally years do it just after they've come back for the That's what it would be. Mm-hmm. You mean on the October thing? I thought it seemed to me that he was saying that everyone would do it because its goal was to give the new in-take idea of no no no no. But I don't think he means that it would be the first-years who've only just arrived would do a poster. Mm. That would be a bit odd, wouldn't it? Okay, so at least anyone who's feeling exactly. But a poster I might do. I might do, I still I'm little bit doubtful. So that's good anyway. So we've got an idea. I think there's thirty talks and and say six, ten posters, whatever we can manage to fit in the room. Mm-hmm. So we need to look at where we're gonna hold it. We could have it in B nine, but there's things all over the wall. Mm. Mm-hmm. There are those pictures that run all the way around, so can we take the pictures down? All these dead linguists. Can we use B nine for the posters for instance? We should find out if generally they use poster boards, if there are some poster boards that we can get ahold of, then that's alright. Mm-hmm. Okay, so poster boards. And what I'll do, I'll email Mits about that, okay? Okay. Write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session. Mm-hmm. So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk. Okay. But the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session, how does it work out with the talks. Okay. What we'll do is we can just say if you want to do a talk, then just say so, and if you want to do a poster, then say you want to do a poster. Mm-hmm. And we can sort of base it around that. Yeah. Yeah. And if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think everyone's kind of done it as a cop-out, then we might have to sort of say to them would you consider doing a talk instead, because particularly the second and third-years, because we need more talks, and just, do it like that. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Mm. Yep. We could even say something like first-years might want to give a poster or something like that because don't maybe that's a bad idea, but. Just throw a general suggestion at them. See what happens. Okay. Okay, so we got some sort of idea of the structure and how many talks we're going to be able to have. The maximum. I guess that will evolve when we get a response from people, perhaps. Okay. But that's fine, isn't it? So we've got three days. Okay, so English language we'll put on the main call, and I'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and English language or something like that, I think. Mm-hmm. And is the other main group then philosophy? Yes, and Informatics, we could think about it as well. So I had a look at whether they do philosophy of a language and logic and stuff here, and they kind of do. There's about three or four full-time members of staff that list philosophy of language as a major interest, so chances are they're gonna have some PHD students that are interested. I think they do. Mm. So do we think we should invite them? I think I'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them. I think that would be amazing if we did. Mm. Still. So I think it's probably worth I don't think we're gonna get inundated with requests. Yeah. So I think it's worth asking them. Philosophy. Yeah. And do you think Informatics would Mm. I think the Informatics are definitely worth asking. There's CSTR and HCRC. Mm-hmm. I'm thinking that the Informatics potentially is quite a big response. Yes. Right, cool. It is. Might be interesting stuff coming in. Read something recently about somebody's Masters project to look in how far English is or in how far English is a shaping influence on programming languages. Would we wanna ask them and put some kind of provisor in to make it specific to sort of preemptively weed out the numbers or should we just say to them we're having this thing about language and, if you got something you think about language, come to Mm-hmm. It is. Yeah. It would be nice to that. It would be nice it would be nice to do it. Mm-hmm. The thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense, because it's such a Because of the way our department is, then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, even by inviting people from Informatics or maybe from Philosophy and things, it might bias it in a particular direction. But I don't know, it's probably not too bad. I think that I think that between Philosophy, Informatics and Psychology you've probably got quite a lot of breadth there anyway. Mm-hmm. The one thing is the only kind of people doing anything like applied linguistics are the applied linguists themselves and people in sociology with an interest in language. Mm-hmm. And I don't think we'd be inviting them. But I don't think that's too bad, because the first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in PPLS, because we are in one school. And then the fact that we also invite people from the Informatics, I suppose it's just that we do have pretty strong ties with them, and I don't think anyone would be too offended. Mm. I hope not anyway. So. What kind of provisor can we put on? We could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year. But I don't know. Hmm. Or we can just, take whatever we get and pick the best between us, which is. Yeah. Let's just do that. Yeah. That's seems most straight-forward. So if you just send them a general thing saying the Linguistics Department's having this conference and would like to invite post-graduates from the Informatics. Yeah. Yeah. So So you're going to email Claire. Yeah. Of. So who wants to send something out to Informatics? I'll do that. That's fine. Yeah? Alright. And should I get in touch with Philosophy as well? Sure. So what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language, but put a warning that if it's logic, then there's a good chance that no one will understand, or not that many. No one will understand. Just maybe if you just just put philosophy of language. That's that's probably good. Yeah. Or some some relevance clause. No, you if I just send them a thing saying the Linguistics Department is having a postgraduate thing, so if you're a Philosophy student with and your work has got an interest in language, then Basically what I was thinking was just sending them your call for papers and changing it slightly to say dear Philosophy students. Or any Yep. Yeah. That's it. That's what you do. I think that's as much as we need to say. Kind of a relevance clause. That's right. So you've gotta work out how to do that and who to email. Mm-hmm. Mm. That's fine. Adjust. That's what you wanna do. As long as it's clear from the subject bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that for Philosophy students with an interest in language and that's it. And then between us we'll have to have another meeting and at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and deciding how to divide up the sessions. Mm-hmm. See someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible, which to me just seemed absolutely crazy. And the reason she gave me was something to do with taking out a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult, but I think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say look, I can have just this one day off, as opposed to when I'll need an hour over an hour each day for three days. Mm-hmm. Mm mm. Yeah. It you can end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off. So I think in general, and also for the sake of the lecturers I think a lot of the time Simon Kirby has already said to me that any of his students he wants to be on the first day, on the Wednesday, right, and that's because I shifted it I basically had it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to begin with, and then it moved down twice to Thursday, Friday. Mm-hmm. So Wednesday is the only day left that he can make. Mm-hmm. I see, right, he wants them there so he can make it. So. Okay. And the other thing is when we get some calls say we have for instance three people supervised by Bob Ladd, then it might be that then we are gonna have to contact Bob and say Bob, these three of your students are gonna be talking. Presumably you want to be there. So can you give us a time that would be good for you? And then we can put them in a block at one time. Yeah. Cause he says okay, Thursday afternoon I've got completely free. Mm, and I think. So I think we do need to stick everyone together, particularly if they've got the same supervisor. And it's also good if talks are on the same topic for a whole morning or a whole afternoon because then people will come along and go this morning it's all on phonology or this morning it's all on applied linguistics. And then Okay? Mm-hmm. As much as possible anyway. I think that's So far it's just a general statement of interest, what we intend to do. What we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff. Yeah. Now if I'm gonna send out this call, we need a deadline for titles. Mm-hmm. What should we say? Something like 'cause we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstracts. So let's set the latest deadline, the the the sort of abstracts deadline first because we need to have a meeting, and that's gonna be when all the real work starts. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. What's the absolute latest? Maybe the end of March might be okay. Two weeks ahead of End of March. Yeah. I'm going away for two weeks on the fourth of April. Mm-hmm. And then I'm coming back just in time for the conference. So any organising, at least stuff where I need to be where we need to meet physically has to be done before that. Mm-hmm. And I will be away probably until Easter. So this actually means we have the week directly after Easter between my coming back and you leaving to get the stuff done. I tell you one thing. It's starting on the Wednesday, and the first day back is Tuesday. I think I'm coming back I'm trying to get this right. Hopefully I'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before. Cause I think I'm gonna be back. Might even have to come in in the evening. But that's not the end of the world, but we might have to set some things up. Maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever. Mm. We might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready. And there's gonna be other things like getting the technology ready. So not only is there a pressure to have talks that are on a similar topic together, but also if people need the same kind of computer set-up, it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it. Mm. Because I think it was Cedric has already offered to do whatever we need him to do. But he just needs to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and and get it ready for them. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So I think hopefully most people will either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have PDF slides or something. What kinds of things do you think people are actually gonna need? Mm-hmm. Hopefully, no one will have anything too specialized. Yeah. In my experience what you usually should have is some kind of what's it, over-head thingo beamer. In some cases we might if it's really tough, we might be in need of a of some sound system to play recordings. If we do it hasn't B nine got all of that? It's got a lot in there. Should be there. But I think sometimes maybe people need to be in Linux rather than Windows and so booting in and out is sometimes an issue. Adjusting. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But I think what we should say is when I put out this call, I'll put both deadlines, and I think I'll say that when you send in your abstract, you need to mention that any technology you intend to use, so that at least if we have all the information? Mm-hmm. Yep. So deadlines. Okay so let's think about this. If we gave them a whole month or just over a month, then that would be okay, wouldn't it, because no, it wouldn't be okay at all. If we gave them the whole month, that'd give us hardly any time. So if we gave them say till mid-March, that would be good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So give them something give them something like ten days or whatever to get the title in, and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done. And the abstract doesn't have to be much, it's probably only half a side of A four or something, isn't it? Mm. Just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into. Yeah. That's all we really need. Mm-hmm. See ideally I would've liked to have given them a bit longer. But I think That will be okay. Nah. No way anymore. Okay. So unfortunately I don't have a calendar. So That's true. Mm neither do I. You're gonna send that pan pen crazy. No, it's I think it's okay when you're not writing on there. So no, it's twenty eight this month, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Two, three, four. I could create us another calendar. So if we have it a Monday, Monday the fourteenth'd probably be quite good for the final deadline. Mm-hmm. And then if I send it out tomorrow, we'll say something like the Or maybe the fourth would be good. So give them a week for the title, and then they would have about ten days from then to actually get the abstract in. For the title deadline? Yeah. Does that sound reasonable? Why not just give them a week to do the abstract? I'm just thinking about no no no, I was I was saying just give them a bit longer to get back with the title. Just put it here? The eleventh. A bit earlier. So I'm saying a week from when I send it out That would be a week anyway. Say get back with the title by the seventh. Or do we need ten days to go from. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That would be a week anyway, but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title, or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it. Yeah. So what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title, or is it gonna be on the basis of the title, do they want more time to write the abstract. I think if they're really serious to be a bit late with the title might not be bad, because it will help them to. So give them the seventh? Mm. Okay, so Monday the seventh is the title. Yep. And this presumably will apply across the board. And Monday the fourteenth for the abstract. Mm-hmm. Yep. And we've got we've got an email address for them to send all this to, haven't we? Or what was it? We kind of have. We were given The only thing is accessing the account. Getting access to the account. Blah blah blah blah. They can send it to PGC at ling as long as we can get the I'll tell you what I'll do then, I'll go and see Mike today and and get the password and everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Cause we possibly have it, but I'll just sort that out with him. Because if we're gonna tell everyone to email PGC, then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and that it's operational and stuff. Mm. Cause so far I've just been using my own email address. But it would be better it's quite easy to send from an email address. Mm-hmm. Cause you can send from any email address you like. It's just the fact that when they reply to it, you need to be able to access it. Yeah. So I already tried it once, and I'm sure they gave us a password. And I even that's it then. Yeah. We've got it all written down. No problem. That's it. So does You may already know, but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts, when you do the philosophy and thingy one, then if you want to send from PGC, then you might already know, but if you did it from web-mail, you can just create a new account for yourself and where it actually has a send from address, and you can just put PGC at ling dot and just do it that way. Mm-hmm. Or depending on your normal email client, you might be able to do it, but it doesn't matter too much. Yeah. The the the other thing you could do is have is just fill in the reply to address as PGC, depending on what you wanna do. Yeah. But that's what I'll do. I'll send it from PGC, so if anyone replies, it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time. Presumably, you can access from web-mail or, MAP or whatever. Should I take care of the web page? If you want to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something, and anything else you might wanna do, and then later on we can put the programme in. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, cool. So Okay? Hmm. Right. No. So am I. Is it five is it almost two? It's not quite it's two or three minutes to. Not quite, but almost. My microphone fell off. You you got something for two, haven't you? Yeah. Right. Okay. So very quickly then, can we arrange a new time to have a meeting? Do you think we need to how long do you think until we need to meet again? Have we got enough to be getting on with. We probably have, haven't we? Yeah. And that would be cool. So ideally I suppose we'll meet again here. So we can with Melissa and we'll just send out an email. Yeah. Okay? Mm-hmm. Okay, so I won't get in touch with Philosophy. Or I won't send anything to Philosophy and Informatics till I've got your email. Cause I'll just tell 'em a modified version of that. Yep. That's fine. But I'll try and get a good address to send it to. Alright. So that was a note. And I'm okay. I think latest soon as the call is out. Yep. Because then we have that away and look at the organisatorial stuff like Do we know about chairs, tea, and stuff? Alright, we're finished. Okay.",
