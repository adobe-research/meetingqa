    "displayText": "Right, so start of the first meeting. Mm-hmm. Uh. Right, so agenda of the first meeting. Where we have twenty five minutes for this meeting. Okay. We are to get acquainted. So does everyone want to say who they are? That seem sensible? Yeah. I'm Robin. I'm the Marketing Manager. I'm Louisa. I'm the User Interface Designer. I'm Nick. I am the Industrial Designer. And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader. Alright okay, so tool training. Um. Project plan. So does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required? Tool training. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. Neither am I. I see, so we shouldn't really be right okay, so. So we have the project team, which is basically to come up with a new remote control device. The starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time. And our idea is to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one, and to be trendier, to be with it, and therefore to get a bigger market share and bigger audience. Yeah. So method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design, the conceptional design, and the detailed design. So in each of these phases we'll basically be handing over to yourselves, the designers of this device. Yes. And having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better implement than we had before. And therefore have a successful conclusion to the day. And you'll be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end. Mm-hmm, okay. So we've got tool training. Try out whiteboard. Uh. So we will. Right so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there. I guess this is make sure the whiteboard works. So I don't know who wishes to go first. Okay. Do you wish to go Have a first bash at whatever. I don't mind. I dunno. Um. Ah. Let's see. Good job I got pockets today. Your microphone's just. But now you'll move out from the microphone and the camera. I take it that I would I would guess so. Are we supposed to do this right now, do you think, or? Or Technical problems. You've lost your microphone there. I don't know. Oh. Right here we go. You designers are meant to come up with these sort of things. Okay. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. Little smiley cat there. And this would be because they're very intelligent, compared to dogs maybe. And they can be very very affectionate. Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats. Um. And they can look after themselves. Next. Okay. I'll I'll Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything. Shall I rub that out, actually? I don't see as there's any need to. There's plenty of space. Whatever. We can have have a whole menagerie. Exactly. Okay. There's one. We've had more time to prepare over this side, so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets. Didn't think of that. Kay pens are over here. The three pens are underneath. I'll try the red pen. Okay. Um. I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well, but I'll have a bash at it. You get marks for artistic impression. Uh. Ooh ooh I lost it there. I think I've just knocked the microphone. Um. So you're just doing the face. We'll then we'll go for a a small small bear. And I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that. Great. Right. Hello. I'm gonna go for the dog, and I'm gonna draw one badly as well. Uh. Looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something. That's quite good. Right. There's my dog. I like dogs because they're very loyal. And they're always happy, so whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired, they're always coming up and they're always quite excited. So you can always have a lot of fun with a dog. And they're also good for exercise as well. You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired. And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well, so. Okay, that's why I like dogs. Right. I've not actually had too many pets over my time 'cause to be honest with you I'm not too keen on them anyway. Not to worry. So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got a few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw. As you can see that my artistic work is useless as well. Anyway. And one of the best things about fish is that they don't really take too much looking after because with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever, you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you. Whereas if you got fish, you just gotta put the food in a a dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you're away and change the water every couple of months, and buy in a few plants, so. Other than the fact that they keep dying, fish are are are reasonable pets in that they're low maintenance. Great. Right. Okay, if we're still all with us. Right okay, so. Work has been done on this project where by twenty five Euros is the expected selling price. Mm-hmm. That information has come from our marketing manager here. Yeah. So we're looking to sell internationally, not just in Europe. We're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half Euro per unit. And therefore making a profit margin of not actually a profit margin it's because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from from that to give you your profit margin per unit. And so depending what the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time. So Experience with remote control, first ideas. New remote. So I guess we're having a discussion at this point in time to help folks design our new model as it were. Yes. So any thoughts? With some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons. As that is the main function. Okay, so basically we're looking for a device that is robust and therefore won't get damaged too easily. Yes. We're looking for a device that is What was the other things you said there? Sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible. Easy to use. Use. Is easy to use and see. And see. Yes. Okay. Uh. Can I just check? Is this just a television remote? Because a lot of systems are kind of TV video combined now, or TV DVD combined. And one of the most annoying things is having five remotes in the house. Mm-hmm. So if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote. Mm. Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? Basically I'll get back to you on that. But it seems to me sensible, 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the room. Yeah. So a device for all remotes. Okay. Sorry, you go. You go. Yeah. One of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well. Cause there's quite often lots and lots. And sometimes they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room. Whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel, now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote. So we need to sort of maybe think about how we could maybe develop a remote control which moves around the room. I don't know. Hmm. Comes to your whistle. That's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television, but. Yeah. But in a sense it's mutually exclusive. You can't have both the the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well, you want any idiot to be able to use it. Yeah. Whilst at the same time you want, as you rightly said, one remote for all. Mm-hmm. And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes, therefore they're more with handling them, therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe we could have better instructions with the remote. Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself, or sort of the instructions that would come with it? Better instructions. Yeah. We've done some research about sort of what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, and a lot of them sort of use they're like mini laptops. Mm-hmm. So it's possible that we could devise a system where you're basically sort of holding a miniature computer which is controlling all your sort of your television, your stereo, and where if you buy a new thing then you can link it to that as well, maybe. Okay. We've got five minutes before the end of the meeting. So we have to start winding up. Is there Next meeting in thirty minutes. Kay. Okay. Right, so we've got ID the Come on, where's my there we go. If you just click return it should be okay. It'll get rid of the message. Or not. If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message. You've got. Yeah. That's what I was looking for. Right. So we've got function what happened to the Right. I think that might be back to the start. Yeah. If you kind of slide to the left and pull it down? Slide four Okay. Yeah. Right. Sorry about that. Okay, so we've got the working design for ID. For UID the technical functions design. Marketing, the user requirement specification. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your by your personal coach. So. Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes? Mm-hmm. And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of this meeting to give it to you for the next meeting. Yes. Kay, yes. Mm-hmm. I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the remote for. Is this a multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it? I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. Television remote control. Right. That's true, 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going. Okay cool. But at this point in time I think you're right that shall we make it just a TV. Okay? Kay. So we will depart. We will stay here and break off. And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour. Okay, that's great. Okay. Okay cheers. Okay.",
