I think they probably ought to, but they've only just started realising that treating this as a legal issue is probably the right way to look at it. Mm-hmm. So they're not really the sort of people that are up for understanding the intricacies of the committee, I guess. You would have thought they could, but it's actually quite hard work. The law isn't very clear. Can't can't they get legal aid? That's a good question. They they might be able to. It's so strapped now, the Citizens Advice Bureau is so hard to actually get access to because they have so many cases and so few people. But that's probably the next thing they'll have to do. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Everything's okay. Are we supposed to count to ten or something? We don't have to do all that? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Right. I thought the right thing to do was to review what Wei-Xun's been doing in the area of dialogue structure for work package one over the last period. So basically for him to talk about what progress he's been making and then for him to describe what work he intends over the next period of the project, and for us to figure out what help he needs with that. Mm-hmm. Maybe give him some help figuring out what publications he's gonna get out of this and for us to make sure that it fits into the overall project. So this is something that we're not gonna do everything today, but I wanted to make sure that we sort of all aligned on what he was doing at the moment and then sort of figured out how to give him the best advice coming up. So that's that's why I called this. Okay, so You're gonna give a presentation for us then. Okay. Okay, thanks. Yeah. A very or a quick slides. Great. So I've been here for fourteen month, I think. So I've accustomed to the environment here and enjoy staying here. So mm from last year I was supervising the annotation of segmentation, summarisation with Jean of the ICSI corpus and on the other hand I did some very preliminary work on chunking the switchboard corpus. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But that was not picked up in the AMI corpus, which is supposed to be. And currently I'm more interested in see analysing the discourse structure in multi-party meetings. This is what I'm going to present here. So in this presentation I'm going to see how we could analyse utterance to utterance relations in multi-party meetings. Cause meetings is a lit different from normal text or a normal dialogue or monologue. So interactivity is a concept that I'm using to distinguish the two extremes of of discourse in meetings. And for dialogues and monologues I think we might have to use different concepts to model the discourse structure. Then I will give a very rough plan for the next couple of month. And finally I will introduce some related work. So the big question that I'm concern here is what's the relationship between utterances in multi-party meetings, or how do we analyse discourse structure right above utterances instead of those high level intentional structure of discourse? So the concern here is about the very local low level utterance-to-utterance relations in multi-party meetings. This is the local discourse structure. So the building block of that kind of structure would be the utterance and possibly one of its properties, the dialogue act which we're currently working on and for meetings, so I've mentioned before that meetings is a bit different from monologue and dialogues. So in meetings from my reading of the one of the AMI meetings IS one O eight, the four meetings, I noticed that the degrees of interaction in the meetings varies from parts to parts. So for some part the interaction is very strong. So it's obviously a dialogue. But for some part part where the interaction is very weak, just the chairman or project manager is mm coordinating the meeting. He's pushing the meeting forward, then this kind of organisational structure or part. And also other parts like the back-channels without any semantic content from other participants. So this kind of interaction might be better analysed as monologue, in which there is interaction, I suppose. So Uh-huh. I'm a little bit confused. When you say interactivity, how would you characterise a highly interactive meeting? Yeah. What are the measurements you'd apply? So I think what you're doing is segmenting meetings into highly interactive parts and not so interactive parts, where you think some of them are a bit like dialogue and some are a bit like monologue. Yeah. What measurements would you apply to find out which? So this is going to be based on the utterance to utterance. So for this utterance, the next utterance, if it's from another speaker, then if it's not a back-channel or something similar, then it's a dialogue. So if speak changes. So speaker change is. So you mean relatively short turns and speaker change. But short turns mm or something very similar might be the second type of interactivity, the weak interactivity. That might not be analysed as a monologue, but as a no no wrong, not as dialogue but as a monologue. Yeah. So for that part for that kind of back-channels we can just skip that to not treat them as interruptions or something like. So so am I right in thinking you think that you can segment meetings maybe into two types of areas, interactive and non-interactive? Then we could just. What are the characteristics of the interactive areas? Yeah. Speak change would be. So okay, so but you just said, I think, that you would characterise short turns as being the non-interactive parts. If it's just some kind of back-channel or it's just a signal signal the speaker is listening or is understanding what's going on. Okay, we can discount back-channels. Is it okay if we talk about this for a minute 'cause I'm confused. Or do you get a Alright. I was just wondering if you were gonna define this more on the slides to come or if this is as much as you're gonna tell us. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright. So. I'm just wondering if he's prepared Sure. Cause if this is all we've got, I think we should have interactive and non-interactive on the board and then figure out what properties going to each just so we're clear what the two mean. Okay But you need to be more precise what you mean by speaker change. So so what did you have more on later slides about this? So for interactivity this is the only slide. So I'd define interactivity to be as a degrees of interaction in meetings. Okay. So which might speak change would be a very good indicator. Mm-hmm. So do you mean all of the speakers are involved in it? No, no. Is it sufficient for two speakers? Right, and then Okay, but you can that's definitional, right. Yeah. No. Actually, so this is a very rough idea of interactivity. If we go further, we might distinguish the interactivity between two, three, or all the groups. So that might be some final definition for the interactivity. But we've also established that it's not just speaker change, it because if you have mm-hmm, okay, then Okay. So that might be the second class. Weak this is a kind of weak interactivity. Yeah. Yeah. So you wouldn't necessarily consider that to change the turns. Those are just back-channels. So one speaker will have the floor channel throughout that and so I guess what you're saying is that the interactive sections would have shorter speaker turns when you're not considering the back-channels as interruptions. Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Definitely. So do. It might be the case that to be interactive there have to be dialogue acts of some specific type in a turn rather than statement, statement, accept, something like that. That's also true. Yeah. Actually 'cause I've looked. Sufficient but not necessary maybe. It if you had a bunch of people all just giving information and opinion around the table and they never actually ask questions of each other, but the turns were actually quite short, which one would it be? Mm-hmm. Okay. So for that case, so this might be a weak definition of interactivity. So if we could figure out if they are really interacting with each other, or just incremental mm presentation of some information. Mm-hmm. So that's different. We might need a more strict or finer definition of interactivity. For the use of this term for the indicator of the degrees of interaction, for the current proposal I think that it's just for distinguish between dialogues and monologues. Cause for these two types of discourse, the the the the two that we are going to analyse the discourse structure might be different. Right, okay. I remember you saying this before. So basically you want to do the segmentation because you're going to apply completely different analyses to the two sections. Right. And also 'cause I have read some of the MOTA corpus. So for some part of that kind of meetings several utterances or dialogue acts are just tagged as statement. So that I don't think that would be very informative for high level analysis. So that's why I'm distinguishing the two kinds of discourse here. So Wei-Xun takes quite a strong position on this difference between these two kinds of group activities because he says that they admit different kinds of analyses. Right, with the non-interactive, more mono-logic sections of the meeting you have to analyse them using something akin to rhetorical structure or something. And with the other sections you you use some other theory to look at them. Mm-hmm. And I actually think that that's a slightly extreme position with regard to the literature that a lot of people might say it doesn't really matter who the different speakers are in an interactive section. You can still build maybe the same argument structure over the top of the basic acts and propositional content that's there. Mm-hmm. And what you get is a messier version of the argument structure because not everybody has the same argument in their brain, for this. But that the same theory or the same analysis can be applied to both parts. Mm-hmm. So I think it's important to keep that in mind, and if you do need to argue that these two kinds of group activities can only be analysed if you use different analytical mechanisms, then you have to explain why that is. Okay. Right, so it it puts an extra burden of proof on the work that you do. Actually I don't quite agree. For example you can't use RST across speakers because the definitions of the relations depend on the intentions of the speaker and different speakers have different intentions. Mm-hmm. Mm. So you can't use the theory. It was meant as a theory for a one person right. So that doesn't mean there aren't other so for. The. Right. But to the degree that a group is building an argument together, I think what you're doing in a group discussion isn't necessarily one coherent argument for the person, but an argument that is the group view. And so maybe it's not RST, but it's more akin to don't is it Toolman? But, not that but the kinds of things where people to try to represent argument structure. Right, but those are really different theories that are trying to get at different things and some of them admit of multiple parties and some of them assume you're in one speaker's head. Right, and Mm-hmm. Are are the important aspects of it for this analysis really that substantively different though? The entire theory is based on intention and the intention of one individual. So RST would be a bad theory to use. But if there's been an argument so far in a group meeting, and somebody makes a statement, they have an intention about how to modify that group argument. So modelling a single contribution by a single speaker, within that you can use RST if you want to, right. But across speakers you can't. Right, but you're Okay, so the relation names aren't right, but Right. They have no relations for things like reject or agree. They the theory doesn't have them. So the so it's not the right theory 'cause the theory is the relations plus the notion of nuclearity. So we need a different theory. Now I think Alex SDRS allows both kinds. Yesterday. Mm-hmm. Might be a. So within a speaker turn you can have things like explanation and cause and all that. But then across speaker turns you can have things like correction or I didn't see any examples of agree or disagree in STRS, but there aren't? Okay. No, I don't think so. There are thirty relations. I. So we should look at at what they are. Yeah. But I don't her the relations have a Yes, so the relation names it's not the names that are important, it's their semantics that are important, right. The relation names are less important. Mm-hmm. People have argued for ages about exactly what relations were in any of these theories. Yeah. Yes. And that's that's less important than what the theory is trying to achieve. And it just seems to me that if you've gotta have two separate apparatuses for the speaker internal argument structure and the group argument structure, that's more apparatus than you should actually need from doing this kind of analysis. Cause in both cases you're building up an argument publicly in this group meeting and then, adding something or changing the existing argument in some way by relating a contribution to what's already on the table. So Mm. And they're the semantics of the relations are based on the semantics of the utterances that they're relating as Alex explained yesterday. And so it is important that these relations have a semantics that's tied to the semantics of the utterances, right. I just think all of these things when they encounter a new genre of actual data, then they end up building new kinds of relations with new kinds of semantics and adding them. Possibly, but few people have tried to, do the kind of truth conditional semantics that, Asher and Lascarides have done, right. That's the entire history of these. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So the theory can handle the kinds of things that happen in meetings, as she explained. The actual computational mechanisms they have currently for building up the trees can't. Now I don't remember, which speaker you in the example she showed yesterday, was it the case that the representation of the utterances and the relations included which speaker was it had the at the at the leaves she didn't show it, but they would have the semantics of the utterances. Mm-hmm. No, just a turn exchange. Mm-hmm. And then she had relation names and handles. Yeah. Actually she used a a a bunch of features to do the automatic parsing. Right. I just I just don't didn't remember seeing in the representation which speaker contributed what. Mm-hmm. Cause she did represent discourse structures 'cause these were the Verbmobil scheduling dialogues. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So the utterances in the representation were uttered by two different parties in the in the examples she showed us, there was some that was just, one party. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It was a monologue, but then there was a snippet of dialogue as well with For this specific set of relations that that they've defined. Right. So there you've got somebody who's doing theoretical development that would claim that you don't need two separate analytical frameworks for these two types of activities that Wei-Xun has identified. Yeah. There might be some higher level structure that you wanna pull out of that. Mm-hmm. I 'cause you were saying you you're you wanna look at this, very local stuff. Utterance to utterance. Very low level. But from that you one would hope you would pull out something high, No, I think working from the bottom up sounds great, but what you can imagine someone saying how did they decide to make it blue, and maybe there was a long blow by and you don't you kind of wanna abstract away from he said this, she said that, to Anyway, I don't think especially if you're not steeped in these theories that it makes a huge difference to you whether we use RST or something like SDRS. To just we need to see how well we could work out of the utterance to utterance. Yeah. Yeah. So. But I think we should try to find a theory that allows multiple speakers and relations to span over more than one. I just prefer it to be one thing rather than two completely separate things and then the added explanation of why it's not possible to have the same thing applied to both halves. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because it is true that if you look at things like damsel and other attempts to come up with annotation schemes for dialogue acts, there was this notion of forward looking and backward looking. Anyway, they're relational. In some way, they're all relational. But there's a different set of tags in there from the kinds of relations you see within RST, for example. Mm-hmm. So if you look at Amanda Stent's thesis and the analysis that she did sort of within a turn she used something like RST. Mm-hmm. And then across turns she used damsel, right. Which probably wouldn't give us the kind of information that we need about relations across turns, just because we really are critically interested in the argument that the group is building up so that we can find the decisions that they made and any counter proposals to proposals that have been made and things. It really is more in the spirit of the RST ish relations than in the damsel kinds of relationships. What we want out of the relationships between speakers here. They are jointly building up an argument structure, and that is the critical thing that we're missing in order to be able to understand what's happening in these meetings. So we wouldn't wanna do the same thing as what she did in this case, just because damsel doesn't give you the right sort of representation between speakers. I it gives you things like accept and reject and. Does it? Okay, I haven't seen it on this kind of data. So maybe Right, okay, but are what I mean is, you wanna make sure you get the argumentative relations, however you do it. In fact RST doesn't give you anything like that. No. Okay. Whichever relations you have to build. Right. Not I'm not saying I'm not saying that there's a particular set of tags or relations that have been defined out there that are the right ones. Right. I'm just saying we need the correct ones for the structure that we're trying to get out of this. Cause we need certain information out of this analysis. Right, okay. So I think it would make more sense to go about this problem figuring out what kinds of relationships we want and then finding and, setting down what the constraints are on the analysis game. That. Wei-Xun's been looking at the data. So that's that's a step for this. He's been looking at the data, okay, to good. Mm-hmm. And then there are lots of different theories of argument. You can also think about the sort of joint problem solving kinds of approaches. Yeah. Yeah. So Clark and Lockbaum and, that kind of thing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That were designed for dialogue, right, and can be expanded to more than two persons. Mm-hmm. Actually the Lockbaum stuff is for groups. Mm-hmm. So for interactivity this is a very weak definition. If we need more then we might use some more finer definition for interactivity. What you'll need in the end is something operational. Yeah. So it's something that you can use to actually segment meetings into the areas that you think are important for this analysis, right? Yeah. So it's not quite clear to me what the different kinds of things are. Okay. So it would be handy if you could take a meeting at some point and say, this is a interactive area and this is a mono-logic area because and we could come up with what kinds of measurements you need. We haven't done past work here on segmenting meetings in that way, but we have done work on characterising different kinds of meetings in terms of how highly interactive they are. But it's a different definition, right. It's in terms of how much all of the people involved in the meeting take equal part in it as opposed to the highest state is people in the meeting just driving it and the other people following whatever people want. Yeah. But those kinds of measures we could use to do this kind of segmentation if it's important to the analysis, right. Okay. But we need clearer definitions of how many different kinds of activities are there. Is it just interactive and non-interactive, or are there there more grades of shading than that. Mm-hmm. And what are the things that you expect in each. What's the back-channelling behaviour. What kind of dialogue acts do you expect. I think that would help you pin down what the definitions are. Okay. Mm so for dialogue, mm there would be some kind of interaction structure. So it in previous discourse studies, especially in discourse analysis exchange is used to describe this kind of local structure. And in conversation the analysis so adjacency pairs are used to describe this kind of structure. But in these two strands or work they just come up with a list, maybe not exhaustive. So. The small part of interaction is exchanging some information. Here information is a little vague. It could be some kind of knowledge what the speaker knows or some kind of thought what the speaker is thinking. So these two kind of mm two kinds of the information might be some kind of a difference. So this is a little bit like the Bell's mm exchange of information for the knowledge. If exchange of opinion some kind of so it's very related to thought, of thinking. Do you think it matters whether something is knowledge or opinion in the way it contributes to the group process? In some case it differs 'cause when we exchange knowledge, we might not challenge the speaker, but when the speaker is talk about what he feels, what he thinks, is proposing something or then other speakers might challenge him or her. Yeah. So that kind of. I sort of have always taken the view that people aren't very good at this kind of rationality. Yeah. And the difference between information and opinion isn't that prominent in the way people do their reasoning. So. Yeah. But that might be some difference interaction patterns. Might be. Cause for information if somebody's seeking some information, then he ask some question and the one knows will gives the answer. But for the opinion or thought stuff, then the speaker might just present some idea and others will comment or challenge the idea. You can't define 'em that way. You can't define the difference between information and opinion that way because that's basically defining as what happened about it. Mm-hmm. Okay. And I think what tends to happen is that if people challenge the facts, you often discover that they weren't actually solid facts anyway, I think the boundary between these is kind of fluid. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's vague. I guess the question is it important to what's it important to? So do you need the difference between information and opinion to do this analysis? Mm see 'cause so far I'm still looking for a so-called principal scheme for the interaction. So. What have you been looking at? I was just gonna say it would be useful to know what But who's they? So you're you've got books that high on your desk. Yeah. Which ones are they? So for the discourse analysis they're using exchange, but they have no classification just to come up with okay, so Sinclair and Coulthard. That's the question. Who? That is. Right. Also at Geneva school they I don't think they list some kind of exchange. But the exchange structure and exchange is first developed in systemic functional grammar along the Halliday and Martin's work. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So actually they have something in a textbook about the exchange. They call it negotiation. So they have some flow charts of the detailed analysis of exchange structure. Mm. Okay. So I'm sort of getting that you think there is a lack in the theory to do with exchange structure at the moment. Yeah. But I'm but I'm not quite clear yet what you think the lack is. Are you thinking it's been a while since I've read this literature. So I don't think there is any kind of principle classification of exchanges. This is Mm-hmm. But my understanding of exchange is that the initiating move introduces a goal to the discourse, and then the remaining moves will contribute to either the meeting of that discourse goal or the decision not to bother with that discourse goal, right. Mm-hmm. And so I'd be surprised if there wasn't work describing things in those terms. Okay. Mm. I know Sinclair and Coulthard is basically about teaching. IRF kind of structure. So you wouldn't expect that to necessarily apply in wider contacts in a way. You might expect to have to extend the theory to do that. But I I think there are other other people have looked at exchange structure and described it in these terms in a way that should really suit your needs. Okay. Mm 'cause from my previous experience we see ananys analysis of information seeking dialogues over telephones. Mm-hmm. So it's about the tourism information. So from my analysis of that kind of dialogues I could say that there only four basic exchanges depend on the direction of the information flow, and also the speaker role. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Cause in the information seeking dialogues the roles of the two participants are different. One is mainly from agency, a tourism agency. That is main information provider while the customer is the information seeker mainly. Mm-hmm. And also mm the direction of information flows for some kind of information, like the price of a specific route, the spots they're going to visit, and also on the kinds of vehicle or transportation. Yeah. So this is a lot like George Horton's work on saying what are the different parameters for these exchanges. Uh-huh. What are the things that characterise the set of exchanges that can happen? Mm. So but there also some variations which I call complex exchanges. So that's just a list. Mm not like the basic exchanges. So is your complaint less about knowing what makes an exchange and more about knowing how you parameterise exchanges for this genre? So what's the range? Okay, so you're worried about what's the range of exchange types for this genre, and that's what you think hasn't been done. I I'm looking for parametric, scheme. Uh-huh. Okay. That's clearer. That's. A parameter or principle. Something like. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And also. And also 'cause in the meetings the speakers might report something they've done in the past and talk about what they are currently doing and also planning some future actions. So this kind of information might also be helpful. Yeah. So have you tried I know of one previous attempt to establish what exchanges are needed for some kinds of industry meetings, and our experience in that project was that you can't really identify exchange structures in these meetings because they don't really follow that pattern. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That exchanges are clear in there're clearer in when you've got fewer people. So there's fewer people trying to pull the discourse goals in different directions. Yeah. And they're clearer when your goals are quite limited. So when you've just got information exchange the or there's a clear task that the people are trying to do and they're focussed on that task, as is normal in dialogue elicitation like map task or your which your information seeking dialogues, which wasn't dialogue elicitation, but it was very constrained in genre. So the answer to the question might be nobody knows what the catalogue of exchanges is for real meetings or for these decision making meetings because you can't identify exchanges, right. Mm-hmm. Have you gone through the meetings and looked for initiations and responses without a prior catalogue, just knowing that initiation introduces a new discourse goal and a response meets or negates that goal in some way. Yeah. Have you tried marking these exchanges? Not marking. Just for my reading of the I IS one O eight four meeting series. Mm-hmm. Just to reading this part. Mm Mm-hmm. I think that don't it'd probably get to hear, more of your presentation because I think there are lots of different candidates and you certainly can't go through and mark up meetings with every scheme we think of. So I think we have to kind of get an overview of what the candidates are if there's two or three that we think are good contenders, then we try to see what works better, right. Yeah. Yeah. But a reading of this, could tell you that there is no case where you're gonna be looking for initiation and responses that's gonna work. Cause you could go through and see that actually the pattern of addressing different discourse goals is too dispersed to be able to do that kind of mark-up. But obviously you wanna have a front-runner scheme in mind before you So that's it. There are a lot of there are a lot more options. So so let's see what what else you've got. Okay. So this is for the dialogue part. For monologues this is. So that was it on dialogue, okay. Yeah. Okay, so no further information is here. Okay. Mm 'cause so for the information and action the action here is not dialogue act but some kind of physical action that the participant's or has done in the past. So it's very unclear to me why you think exchange of information is more principal what did you have specific schemes in mind there? Or mm specific people's work But can you give us an example of a scheme that's based on exchange of information? He's going to do the future. Do you mean an action in terms of what the group is requiring him to do or do you mean an action in picking something up? So not Physical sense. So action in the technical meeting sense or just action in the physical sense. Right, okay. Physical sense. So this kind of might be some kind of semantics of the utterance or exchange. So this is just one thing one parameter for mm-hmm. Here the scheme is for exchange scheme. For for exchange of information. Okay. So there might be the speaker, and a hearer. So who speaks to whom so this is the so direction of the information flow and also so speaker role might be first parameters for the information exchanges. Mm-hmm. But for action that might be some kind of propose or accept or reject kind of exchange structure. So that's not a physical action, right? If I pick this up, which is a physical action, you can't reject that. Uh-huh. No no. What do you mean? No that's the So we're going to do something so could you do something or this kind of action related utterance. Right. Yeah. That's right, that's a action in the sort of technical sense of meetings. Okay, technical sense. So you are actioned to do something, which is part of the permanent record that okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, that's. Okay, so I think that there are a lot of things that we have to look at before. Before come up with the scheme, you mean. Yeah. And we're marking up a lot of higher level things in our Okay. There are very few schemes for marking up exchanges on actual data, right, because people haven't considered it very important. So. I always thought they get tired after marking up the dialogue moves so they never bother with any higher level dialogue structure. So we did it in the map task, but I don't actually know of other cases where people bothered marking anything higher level than the map than the move structure. Right? You don't know On I've sorry. Stent does. Stent. But it's not been very popular probably 'cause it makes Different. Mm no. Have you looked at Nate Blaylock's work? So 'cause I might not familiar with these Mm-hmm. So he has things like, adopt so basically it's to, collaborative problem solving, more than one person involved, and trying to characterise things as if I can't remember the I can't remember the names of all the actions. Is it the work described in in the coconut project or something similar? No, so the Coconut project is a project that I did with Rich Thomasson and Barbara DiGinio. Have you looked at that? Look not very much detail. Not very clear. No. Though there's a lot of detail in the paper. Yeah. But you haven't looked at it in very much detail. No, not. Okay, so I think you should, because it was all these things that are done for joint problem solving and joint action are very relevant to look at because these people are solving a problem together, right. Okay. Yeah. So while these schemes may not have they have some of the essential components that you need to characterise joint problem solving. So while you may think that they're missing something, then we could certainly augment them. But I think that they have to be looked at. So Nate Blaylock tried to okay, so from Gross and Krauss and Gross and Sidener came all this stuff about shared plans and how you really can't understand, dialogue unless you understand shared plans. But the actual theoretical or formalisation of it was incredibly complex. Yes, yes. And so Lockbaum simplified it quite and, Sidener and Rich and Collagen have simplified it quite a bit. But Nate Blaylock tried to define, what happens after somebody suggests something. You can I can't remember okay, but he has a taxonomy right. I know okay. Oh. I know this guy. Jim @'s student. I know. No no, in Saarbruecken. Exactly, right. Okay. Okay. I know, her. Which we tried to apply to tutoring, but it actually doesn't work very well for tutoring 'cause tutoring's just a totally different ball game. Okay. But we spent a fair amount of time looking at it and it did strike me that for joint problem solving there there were some good ideas. And there is, a set of tags and what they mean and, that sort of thing. And then you can also look at, Clark on joint action. Now he's not gonna give you a set of tags 'cause that's not the kind of guy he is. No. But the overarching idea, I mean accounts for a lot of the ways in which these other people are thinking. Mm-hmm. But I think that we basically have to merge some of this stuff that's been done, on meetings with some of the stuff that's been done on collaborative problem solving 'cause there's elements of each that seem really important. Mm-hmm. And I think Because it really seems to me that, if you look at and some of this stuff on exchange is ancient and they didn't have the ability to mark up lots of data and count things. The first step is find out in how much of the material does the collaborative problem solving cover? How much of a genre clash is there here? So all the conversational analysis stuff, those guys never count anything. No. So they see a pattern and then they think it's kinda cute and then they scour the world for third turn repairs. They don't actually say how often do those happen. It's. I know Manny Schegloff really well and they're not counters. They're purposely not counters. They define themselves as non-counters. But there there are people in the field that are moving that direction, like Martin. Mm-hmm. And also what's important here is the theoretical clarity about what an initiation and a response is. So what is it that ties different acts together at a higher level. Mm-hmm. It does seem like, there's something that we want from that and then there's something that we want from collaborative problem solving. Mm-hmm. And if you if you take the exchange stuff, it's not gonna quite do everything you want, and if you look at the collaborative problem solving stuff, maybe it won't do every that you want. And so. But I think more important than looking at whether parts of the meeting are highly interactive or not so interactive is looking at what sort of task the people are trying to do at the moment. Are they as in the kick off just exchanging information to get started with a project or are they actually addressing some specific design criteria at the moment. Should try to decide which shape the thing is. Because that's going to affect the kinds of relations that you get between the utterances. And so that is much more like the literature from McGrath about the different kinds of activities groups get into. Yeah. So I think that's another thing that has to be pulled into this because you do require different kinds of relations. Or you expect different kinds of relations from some over-arching set in those different kinds of activities. Yeah. What's the high level version again? So main actions guess might be some high level problem solving or decision making concepts, not like the exchange which I would like to be very low level utterance to utterance relations. Right, okay. It might be, built Okay, so Okay. Meeting action. The meeting actions is just gonna be a segmentation. It's not going to present any any micro-structure. So it's just gonna say from here to here they're doing something. That's all that that scheme is gonna do. Somebody's writing on the white-board or the meeting actions they presented at the review seemed really low level to me, like somebody stood up. Okay. That's not those that's individual actions. Okay. Physical. Some kind of physical actions. And the meeting actions are meant to become more semantic and more theoretical than the kind IDIAP have traditionally used. Okay. Okay. So we need to still preserve some sense of the activity. Okay. But rather than saying somebody's at the white-board, it'll be, that somebody's explaining something that the others are focussed on. Okay. Okay. I realise it's important to recognise that, what Wei-Xun got up and went to the white-board. I realise that's important. Yeah. But I was kind of surprised that those meeting actions. So mm okay. It's it's a different scheme. Different scheme. Yeah. So the main actions that you're talk about might be, built up from the exchange. At least exchange might be one kind of important information for that kind of. Mm-hmm. You might need the meeting action segmentation in order to know what area you're circumventing for so, it's just exchange structure in this area that you're looking at, and then that's a solid boundary between the next bit or something. I don't know. But time's getting on. Okay. What practical things can we do to help this work move forward? So show what else you're thinking about. Next. Yeah. For the monologue I have not looked into the details about this kind of relations for the monologue parts. Just a list of these relations. And so next I need to review the literature and come up with schemes for the real data annotation. Mm-hmm. And after that we 'cause this mm is not in the hub corpus. So we are not going to get all the meetings annotated with that kind of. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we might first try a few meetings and have a reliability study. If it's reliable enough, then we must just annotate a small part of the meetings and using some learning techniques to boot-strap the automatic analyser. Marking up exchange structure if it's there and if you've got a working scheme for it is relatively cheap. Mm-hmm. It's a lot cheaper than doing dialogue act coding in the first place. If it's based on the dialogue acts. Right, one presumes otherwise it's gonna be radically expensive to do any kind of mark-up. Mm-hmm. So it's something that we can look at, but what we need it's more important than knowing, that we need exchange structure marked up on X amount of data at this point is knowing where you're headed with this, I think. So what's the good that the project gets out of this in the end. So what's the headline results of the work on the project, is what we're trying to get a sense of here. Yes. So you get your exchange structure marked up. And say we just put in the money, get exchange structure marked up on that entire hub or, figure out how to boot-strap it so we get this how do you sell that as a project goal? Hmm. Cause people are gonna say exchange structure, so what. What do you how do you plug that into the stuff, right? Or fits the meeting browser. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so mm This might not be the final goal that could fit into the browser. But it might be some kind of information which might benefit meeting actions or some more high level decision making or problem solving. Mm-hmm. Cause this is the building blocks, I guess. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. See 'cause I think that just to make this more efficient, you should be thinking about the high-level goal in order to focus the work that you're doing rather than thinking how can we apply these theories to it. Yeah. And then seeing what comes out of that that might be useful for the meeting browser, actually trying to say we have a goal of being able to do this with the meeting browser, what kinds of dialogue structure would we need to be able to do that. Okay. Mm-hmm. I don't know, maybe you'd wanna disagree with that, but this more goal directed might actually make it easier to bring these things to publication in the long run, right? I think we should approach it both ways. I the meeting browser people have a lot of constraints. And so what they end up with saying is most critical for them right now might not be the most interesting thing in the longer term. Right. And so Right. It's not necessarily what they say. But it's at least identify something that we'd hope to get out of it. People have said over and over again that they would like to understand how a decision has evolved, right. Mm-hmm. And I think that I don't know if all of this low level stuff would allow you to track that kind of thing, but it might at least be the building blocks of allowing you to track that kind of thing and some higher level. So after this if we might do some mm from here we might be some problem solving, decision making process to track that kind of information. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's clear that something at this level needs to be there. And to ask questions, like who disagreed or were there any counter proposals or whatever. Even those kind of questions you need some kind of mark-up like this. It just helps which theory you should be concentrating on. So that immediately discounts exchange structures that are mostly for information seeking alone because the notion exchange is to restrict it there, in favour of these more argumentative things. So I do think you should keep in mind what the final goal is so that you can plug this into something at the end and show some benefit of having the mark-up. Yeah. That brings up something interesting because I think probably what we should do is try to get some of these tasks sort of put on, sort of as part of the official agenda. So being able to answer questions like were there any counter proposals to the banana shape or whatever. Or to some specific, recommendation and things like that. Mm-hmm. Those, strike me as clear things that, people who go to decision making meetings want to know if they've missed one or are arriving late or anything like that. Yeah. So it seems like we should probably get some of these things on the official agenda and say look, wouldn't it be nice if you could have answers to these questions, or something. Yeah. Operationally it's not gonna much difference whether it's hub or not, right, because we've got the bank of people. Oh. We have to get the hub stuff through, but he's not ready with an annotation scheme that can be used at the moment anyway. So And it's not that expensive. No, So And I think we wouldn't wanna necessarily do this on ICSI data. It's something that we can afford off budget 'cause it and it's too different a genre. I think the ICSI data is too complex, and there aren't enough real decisions made, that you could clearly identify. Messy. Hmm. Mm-hmm. There are some, and not that I've read more than about two meetings. Mm. Yeah. But so one thing that's gonna be interesting to me, is what can you do because presumably the DFKI folk or somebody is gonna mark up a lot of the data with sort of tags about ontology, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we know, somebody will have gone and by hand and sort of marked up something like shallow semanticy kinds of things, right, or maybe deeper semanticy things, but that but not really in a formal language, but mostly just, tags, right? That's not help either. But they're sure to do that. And then the question is, how does you know, just the way people typically do this is, let's take these semantic features into or these features into account and see how well we do with the learning, and then let's throw these features out and see how well we do, because we know we're gonna have them, because one or two sides really are really interested in this ontology stuff, right? TNO is and DFKI is, right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So there will be some kind of domain semantics. And there will also be presumably some kind of task hierarchy modelling going on in 'cause the whole browser working group final sort of presentation on that second day was about, knowing the task, right. In the Mm-hmm. And very details about which sub-task is this little chunk of the meeting addressing and furthering in various ways, right. I don't remember that about the but that was about what task the person doing the browsing was gonna do. Which seems like it would be really hard in an open domain. You remember when Steve came in, Steve Whittaker came in at the end and said, they'd spent the morning talking and they came up with this idea. No, they said people are talking about tasks. Mm. It they didn't say anything about what sort of information they'd want from the meeting itself. It was about That was that we the browser task. They just mention that they want decision for issues, action items. I think they are more talking about user requirement for the meeting than soft text, they want to know what happened happening in a meeting. They made it clear that that was gonna be heavily No, those are the scenarios. They've identified these seven different tasks people might wanna do with browsers, join a meeting late and catch up on what's happened in the meeting so far, be at home waiting for the washing repair guy. And. They say that? Those are the user scenarios. The task what he came back and said that at the end, it actually kind kind of scared me, because it was all based around tasks. Okay, maybe. And the domain tasks, okay, they now have to decide how many buttons to put on this thing. It was all about the domain task. Okay. It and given that, it's really scary to think about what you could possibly do in an open domain where you don't know what the tasks are. And I don't think you're gonna be able to figure them out very reliably. Mm-hmm. But I thought you wanted to avoid doing stuff that was stuck in this particular domain if possible. But they weren't concentrating. But the whole project is, focussed on AMI hub data as their first priority. But that doesn't mean you have to be using the techniques that you can be using open-domain Mm-hmm. No no no no no, but if the if they had they had this sort of epiphany at the end of this meeting where they decided why are people browsing this. It's all to see how, the participants were furthering their tasks. And you don't think that can be done in open domain at all. Cause we don't wanna get into working with ontologies. One of the strengths of this grouping was that, they all work with the closed domain ontologies and we'll do the open-domain side of things. So I don't know. Right. Yes, and then there was this confusion about the last spider phone conference that the messages telling people to call came out after the meeting happened, at least to some of us. We'll see. Right. So we don't know what happened at that one. Yeah. So we'll get that back on track. But I think that there will be some meeting browser demo that I think it's an interesting question of okay if you have knowledge, here's what you can do. If you don't have that knowledge you have to do different things and, you can't necessarily I think when he does these learning experiments, he should do 'em two ways. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you're advising Wei-Xun that he should be using any ontologies and propositional content that DFKI and TNO bank in the CVS repository, or not? Mm-hmm. That's what I'm not clear on. Because he will have this opportunity with or without. With our without. Mm-hmm. And then we can see without, these tags so Alex was showing yesterday without knowing the head word of the utterance at the leaf, you get these kinds of results, and when you add that in, you get these other kinds of results. That's kind of. Okay. And I think. Different feature combination. So I think if we have those features, it's, a rare rare opportunity that you can, try one head to head against the other. Can actually try. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then of course to make sure that you really Right. I don't know when they'll bank these by the way. cause it's not hub. So it's one of these things where everybody's supposed to bank as many things as possible. So. We won't use 'em till they're ready obviously. So although it will be a closed domain, we can't use any domain information necessarily. But open. There probably are a bunch of issues like if you've got a hundred hours of meetings and they all talk about a lot of the same things, then it it's not really open domain and somehow that sneaks into all the statistics anyway 'cause you don't have such a wide vocabulary and, Right. It's not really an open domain task. Eventually the hub is supposed to be forty percent non-scenario. But that data's definitely gonna be kind of coming in the last. So Mm-hmm. Sure, so we might find that when we move from what we thought was open domain, but on the hub, our results go down when we truly are getting meeting. Yeah. That's quite reasonable. So that'll be interesting. We've got five ISCA meetings actually which are still an elicitation task, but they're not our domain. So that should help some. Okay, that's good. And they've been declared hub. So so they'll accrue all of the normal annotations. Of course you'll never get the TNO and DFKI stuff on it 'cause they're only billing stuff for the one just figure out how we're gonna help him to try to make this more efficient. So okay. So we wanna decide what Wei-Xun should do next and maybe think about meeting in, don't a month or something. Mm-hmm. So before we do that, can I just ask you a question about chunking? Yes. In the beginning you said something about you were doing this chunking and you're doing it on the ICSI data, but did you say it wasn't picked up in AMI or you I I was confused about Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was supposed to chunk some part of the AMI meetings, to see if the chunker channel switchboard works well enough or not. If not, then mm we have to use some kind of supervised learning or some boot-strapping to to do the chunking. Mm-hmm. And you and you haven't done it yet. No, no, 'cause I was a bit worried about this kind of discourse structure. That's fine. So that's still on the agenda to do at some point. Yeah. But we should make sure we finish that off, because otherwise that work's just wasted, right. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. We're gonna use chunks for something useful. That's so right. Okay. Chunks are gonna be named entities if nothing else. Or building blocks. So we have to think about how chunking interacts with the automatic segmentation. Because Barbara was showing the low level. Automatic segmentation at which level? Dialogue segmentaton. Uh-huh. Dialogue act. Okay. And it seems to me that chunking should have some kind of so if your dialogue act segmenter says there's a segment here, but your chunker said no, this is a coherent chunk, then maybe they could work together to do a better job than Right. Yeah. And that's a problem. Yeah. Certainly if you've got chunks it ought to help where your dialogue act boundaries better not be. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And it may be even more mechanical than that based on the examples we're seeing from DFKI. Mm-hmm. Cause they're they're hand marking stuff and the dialogue act boundaries are supposed to be intentional. But they seem to always be marking them that after verbs, with clause it looks quite mechanical. Periods. Right. Hmm. Mm-hmm. So we're querying them about this because that's not the way they're supposed to be doing it. Okay. Right, okay. And hold on. Good. So it sounds like how much AMI you wanted to do the chunking on the AMI data, right? But when do we need chunking by? So I don't like the idea that, you start something and then eighteen months later you pick up to do the last ten percent of the work to finish it off or whatever. So it I like things kinda tidy. Right. How much work is there left and when do we actually need it by would be useful to discuss. Yeah. Because So we got stuck at some point on evaluation of chunking, right. The AMI data is is there. There's hub set A is transcribed in final form. You we can check the Wikis. But the data is rolling in. So And but Barbara still says somebody's done this for chunks. The problem was you didn't have ICSI data that was hand labelled for chunks. Or AMI data. No. And we decided labelling the ICSI data for chunks would be probably difficult and maybe not very useful. And so it Okay, if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could evaluate so train on some and evaluate on some, wouldn't that 'cause you've trained on Switchboard, right, where there are chunks. Okay. I'll have to look up, so Mm. So Mm-hmm. So if you had some ICSI data that you could maybe use, don't as a what's the there's a training set and then there's the development set and then there's the test set. Yeah. Maybe you'd use some chunked ICSI stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then evaluate. Mm-hmm. But I can see why Wei-Xun didn't wanna spend his time chunking ICSI Which means we have to get some portion of the data hand-chunked. Hand-chunked. Mm-hmm. But that shouldn't be that hard to do, right? How much data do you need? How much in Switchboard. I don't read lips. What was that? Was it hard? Switchboard is all chunked. Yeah. Yeah. Right. They the data how much data you need was not a problem with the Switchboard 'cause he had lots. So he didn't have to think about how much. So we need to know how much data you need hand-chunked. Right. No, you had Penn tree-bank parses, and you made chunks from that. And then how do you hand-chunk stuff, right. So you were were working on instructions for doing hand-chunking. Mm. For Switchboard. But then there were two possible options for doing this on the AMI data. For Switchboard. You could either essentially go the same route as they did with the Switchboard do the Penn tree-bank and then create the chunks off that, or you could chunk directly. Mm-hmm. And it wasn't clear to us which one of those two methods was the right way to do this. Direct chunking, 'cause we are not going to in a tree out of the AMI data. Right, so you'd have to produce as part of this exercise. Is anybody gonna parse? Is any gonna try to anybody try to parse the AMI data? You would've thought so, but I dunno. So DFKI, 'cause they're working on some HPSG parsing. Yes, I'd forgotten about that. Mm-hmm. Might be. Might be. If I'm I guess that if they're different then we might just write another script to do the translation. But that's not very similar. I don't know very much about grammar. Is is that similar enough that that this same method could apply that we derive chunks off the HPSG output? I think you might lose a lot in, this step. So basically your your chunker is trained on something that was derived off Penn tree-bank. Mm-hmm. And it might be different enough that that actually causes it not to match. If you're suddenly evaluating against chunks that were done using HPSG I don't know about grammar, but it. Okay. I need to look at some of to see. They're using the ERG, right? Which probably has a maybe finer which I believe has finer grained distinctions and different labels, than the Penn tree-bank. Mm-hmm. And the mappings can be pretty difficult for this, right? Or is is easy to map between finer grained distinctions and coarser ones? It's I'm it's probably easy to dumb down the HPSG parse too. Think so? Cause the Penn tree-bank parsers are pretty minimal because they didn't wanna commit to a specific grammatical theory. Yeah. So it probably is worth looking at 'Cause they're doing this with Dan Flickinger, right? Okay. Which is the same parser as the Redwoods Tree-bank was made with that Alex talked about yesterday. Mm-hmm. So you can look at Redwoods parses and see how different they are from tree-bank parses. And you might wanna talk to Alex to find out if somebody's already done this turn Redwoods stuff into tree-bank stuff so that they can compare, against results that are reported on tree-bank. Mm-hmm. Huh. The names would suggest that this was the idea, right. That was the idea believe, but it was supposed to be another tree-bank. Yeah. Right. So that sort of assumes that we think it's better to do this by deriving chunks from some parsed format than just hand chunking the stuff. The good thing about that is that then you know that when you go through and parse you'll be getting the same chunks as when you do this process automatically. Cause the problem when you go through and hand do it is then suddenly you introduce your automatic method and your accuracy goes can go way down. Mm-hmm. Sometimes sort of for part of speech tagging, whether you do it by hand or machine, it's pretty much the same accuracy, right. Yeah. But They talked about it at the meeting that we went to in Twente. So let's try it this way, and then that puts off the question of when do we have to do this to when we get HPSG stuff, right? Can you ask DFKI whether they can give us a couple AMI meetings run through their HPSG process? Mm-hmm. I don't even know what time scale they had in mind. It is this something they were doing it at the moment, but I don't know whether this was very preliminary or do you remember? Twenty minute. Twente. Mm-hmm. I was thinking Enschede. Why can't I remember the the the right name of this place? Mm-hmm. Yes, Twente. Contact. Which You were there Jean. Yeah. Okay. Yeah? You're expecting me to remember stuff, aren't you? No no no no, no no no, I I know you missed a meeting and so there may have been you missed the one in TNO. I don't even know which one I've missed. Brussels, Amsterdam. TNO, okay. TNO. See, I wasn't there. So I don't know where it was. Okay. cause they did some work bio project with the HPSG parsing. At least bio. On on which project? Sorry, I didn't get that. Verbmobil, right. Maybe. Yes, yes, they did. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. So ask 'em, right. That's that's what Alex talked about yesterday, right. Okay. Mm-hmm. The parse that's wasn't something she did, but that's the data she's using, right. Mm-hmm. So we have all that stuff here, the parsed Verbmobil material. So you can look at that and see what the parse trees look like. You don't need to wait for DFKI. No. And if it turns out that you think there's no way I can map these into Penn tree-bank style bracketing, then we have to think of something else, right. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. But I think they had that in mind. So it's it's worth also talking to her about that. Okay, good. So it's talk to Alex, see if it looks like it maps by looking at the Verbmobil. If it does, ask DFKI either for data or a time scale, and you're gonna need to know how much data you need in order to do that. Do you have a technique for estimating how much data you'd need? Yeah. Not sure Okay. I don't know how you do that, so who knows how you do that? Everybody always says there's no data more data. Okay. So just ask DFKI how much data and when, right. If I know. The typical thing is to leave one out cross validation with, eighty nine dialogues. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so I trained on eighty eight or I train on one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and Okay, but we should speak to Steve. Okay. We don't have any particular time in mind when we need a chunker that works on this stuff. We might have some the question is what is gonna help? So. I think chunking could help automatic dialogue act segmentation. I think chunking could help, as you mentioned, named entity recognition. Yeah. Mm-hmm. If we did a chunked version of the AMI data and stuck it into CVS under the automatic contributions then people would end up using it, 'cause they do that, right. Mm-hmm. So the question is at what stage should we put that in? We'd wanna make sure we're pretty happy that it's reliable because Mm. So post-evaluation so we can put in some idea of what the evaluation is like. Otherwise you get these very bizarre results because the data is not really very good. Mm-hmm. But I and nobody has expressed massive interest in chunking. So I think, nobody's waiting for it. No, but he's relying it on it this summer. But but we could we I think we should talk to Barbara about how to do some joint experiments or or if she's gonna be sending other people, maybe Liz or whoever comes over next time. And it would actually be great if it was Liz, because I think she is the one who did the dialogue act segmentation automatic She just said that hopefully by the next meeting she would be bringing someone else, or someone else would be coming instead of her, remember? Mm-hmm. So when when do you think that would be? When when is she sending somebody? For the next one, mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. But that's a pretty tight time scale then, right, 'cause it'd be for the fall we'd wanna know the evaluation. Is that the time scale you're thinking of or How it could be done. The not to have not to have it done, but just to talk about how it could interact with automatic dialogue act segmentation. Yeah. And I guess we should talk to Yoshi about it in relationship to named entities. Who's doing named entities besides Yoshi? That's all I think. Okay. Mm-hmm. So we could talk to Vasilis about that as well. I think you should still ask Barbara again, can you have another think about who might have the chunking stuff. Cause she has said several times there must be somebody and she can help with that. And I think she's just forgotten. So and then we can evaluate on the ICSI, pretty easily. So one thing that would be very helpful for me because we're in a situation where Jean, has read a lot of literature and I've read a lot of literature and there is some overlap, but there's also quite a big space where we don't know the literature from the other side. And since you're gonna be reading it, it would probably be useful if you made some kind of, report that described, okay, what these people this is, a synthesis okay, here's the basic idea behind exchange structure and, here's here's the two most relevant works that I've read or something like that, to just Or even just a paragraph of, the basic idea. Even if it's just on a Wiki the references and then why they're relevant, right. You don't wanna make this really formal, or do you? A paragraph each. Just because, obviously I'm not gonna go off and read all this kind of stuff because I don't have time. Yeah. And you probably don't have time to read all this collaborative problem solving. Yeah. But that would help us be a lot more specific than just listing bullet points on slides cause then we'd know sort of which literature you're thinking of putting in and we could read the most important argumentative stuff. In any way, every time you write a paper, you've got to go back and do this related work thing anyway. Okay. Yeah. I can have these things anyway. So it just makes it a lot easier to get that common ground. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Kay. I think it's a real advantage that we've read different things and come at it from a different side because I think they the the previous approaches haven't really, taken the good features from, both sides and tried to put them together. Mm-hmm. They haven't addressed this problem. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. I'm gonna have to go very soon because I've got this hearing to go to. Me too. So the practical actions, what are the things we're gonna go away and do. I think we both wanna send don't maybe you've already done this, but I will send you or we can, chat off-line for a minute about a list of things that I think you really need to take a look at. Yeah. And Jean, probably maybe you should do the same. Okay. And if Sabrina has any ideas, we'd be happy to hear from Sabrina as well. So then later? Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right now I'm trying to do the meeting action segmentation. Because after talking to Jane just we have different ideas whether meeting action will be about the same size as topic segments. Okay. So it would be good to right now I'm doing this, looking at the data and trying to see if I can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme, and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. If that do, then maybe we can talk again whether it make sense. Yeah. Yeah. So you can do this exercise and then come and talk to me some time next week. Mm-hmm. I'm not in Monday, but the other days I'll be around. Alright. Mm-hmm. I have just started. And so far it's it I think it's still about the same level of segmentation we're talking here. Yeah. But maybe the boundary will not be exactly the same. Yeah. So this is interesting, but I don't think we can afford to look at this right now. But that the segment Mm-hmm, right, sure. So why don't you bring it by next week? Yeah. And what I really wanna do concentrate just now is finding out how we're gonna help Wei-Xun with making progress on this. Mm-hmm. Mm, sure. Mm-hmm. Yes. So he's gonna construct a list of the references he thinks is important, and Johanna and you as well are gonna contribute to that. Mm-hmm. And we can put that on a Wiki or we can do it some other way. I'm Wiki mad. Mm-hmm. Okay. So if we share it, it should go on a Wiki 'cause I can't find anything in my email. Hmm. But, you don't have to do that. It's. Hmm. And then you're actually so what you're doing is taking all of the the most important references for finding argument structure that might eventually be of some use to a meeting browser and trying to look at actual data and apply and see which one helps you figure out what you're actually gonna do with this particular data, right. So it seems to me that we should take the front-runner scheme and the data and you should look at not front-runner scheme but front-runner theory and see if you can speak to the data, using that kind of theory at some point. And might be an interesting exercise, right? I think we need to like you mentioned earlier, factor in what this might be used for in the end. And so even if it we won't it won't be used, maybe if it would need some higher level analysis before it could be directly used for that purpose, we should still keep that in mind. The update. And so I think going through the presentations that were given at the work package six meeting where and I think it wasn't was it Anita or was it I've forgotten her name, the other woman from Twente, they talked about they had done a lot of questionnaires, and they got some user requirements out of that. Mm-hmm. Hmm. And then Steve presented the results of following people around and looking at how they used their notes from meetings. Mm-hmm. Hmm. And so that would give us some ideas about, what people want, out of meeting records. But then we should also add things that we think are interesting. Yeah. But that's a good starting point. But just to have to keep some of these goals in mind 'cause they're one scheme might let you answer this set of questions but wouldn't help you at all with another set of questions. That'll be the Exactly. So you wanna go through basically the user requirements and, maybe think about some user requirements of your own and make a case for, these are the kinds of things that we'd want, and look, you're gonna need this kind of dialogue or argument structure for it. Should we expect that all the slides from the work package six meeting or the joint work package five work will be up on one of the work package web sites? And if not, how do we make that happen? I'll think about that. Okay. Some of this was presented in at least the one spider phone or the second spider phone telecon I went to for work package six. So if they're not on the web we can try to look at the materials that were presented in that telecon without necessarily listening to the whole telecon. Yeah? Yeah. So we're just trying to get records. And Steve and. I'm sure they're not on the web yet. So. They've I think they may have written this up in a report but I would hope that's on the work package six web site as well. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So we're gonna go through the requirements like that and did you think that was reasonable after that to try and actually, take some theory that seems fairly reasonable and think about the particular data and come and talk? Once he's read a couple more he's just completely missed out the collaborative problem solving world, which I really think we need to take into account. Yeah. There's a few references missing. Yeah. You may take it into account and say no, you're wrong, and here's why, but I I'm gonna need some convincing. Yep. So then try front-runner scheme on, a front-runner theory. Or or two and see this one gives you this and this and can't are they fundamentally incompatible. Or can we mm-hmm. Yeah. But try it informally. Yep, mm-hmm. When do we get together again? Cause I really do have to go. Okay. I promised these guys I'd be there. I think this is gonna take about three weeks 'cause he's got plenty of reading to do. Uh-huh. But Reading lists before that though, so right? So maybe I'll send them the references immediately. So we'll get together in about three weeks. Okay. Uh-huh. Is that enough time for you do you think? Sorry? You mean mm. Is that enough time for you to read and think about If if it's too tight, I think we can say four. I will try my best. I might 'cause Julie and the boy is here. Or are you gonna be on holiday? So. It's a little tiring 'cause my parents have left. Yeah. So I might take two weeks off in May, sometimes. Maybe four weeks? Okay. Okay. So we should get together probably in about four weeks, yes. Off. Four weeks. Okay, thanks. So when are you gonna bring this beautiful baby in to see everybody? Mm. I hope so very soon. I want to see. Yeah. Yeah. Good, good. Something. That's great. Sure. Right. I'm gonna head off. Yep. Good luck solving your problem. Okay, thanks. Mm-hmm. Cause floods are more important than dialogue structure, I'm afraid. I have to tick and tick? It does something weird when you do that.",
