# Conda Environments and Requirements
Throughout this project we will be using multiple `conda` environments as indicated. These include: `datasets`, `disfluency`, `download`, `pyannote`, `qa`, and `rpunct`. This folder contains the requirement files for each of these environments in the form of `[name]_requirements.txt`. The respective environments can be created using: 
```
$ conda create --name [env name] --file [env name]_requirements.txt
```
